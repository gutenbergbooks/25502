<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N refashioning, for the pleasure of readers of the
twentieth century, these versions of ancient tales
which have given pleasure to story-lovers of all
centuries from the eighth onward, I feel that some
explanation of my choice is necessary. Men&rsquo;s conceptions
of the heroic change with changing years, and vary
with each individual mind; hence it often happens that
one person sees in a legend only the central heroism,
while another sees only the inartistic details of medi&aelig;val
life which tend to disguise and warp the heroic quality.</p>

<p>It may be that to some people the heroes I have
chosen do not seem heroic, but there is no doubt that
to the age and generation which wrote or sang of them
they appeared real heroes, worthy of remembrance and
celebration, and it has been my object to come as close
as possible to the medi&aelig;val mind, with its elementary
conceptions of honour, loyalty, devotion, and duty. I
have therefore altered the tales as little as I could,
and have tried to put them as fairly as possible before
modern readers, bearing in mind the altered conditions
of things and of intellects to-day.</p>

<p>In the work of selecting and retelling these stories
I have to acknowledge with most hearty thanks the
help and advice of Mr. F. E. Bumby, B.A., of the
University College, Nottingham, who has been throughout
a most kind and candid censor or critic. His
help has been in every way invaluable. I have also
to acknowledge the generous permission given me by
Mr. W. B. Yeats to write in prose the story of his
beautiful play, &ldquo;The Countess Cathleen,&rdquo; and to adorn
it with quotations from that play.</p>

<p>The poetical quotations are attributed to the authors
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg&nbsp;x]</a></span>
from whose works they are taken wherever it is possible.
When medi&aelig;val passages occur which are not
thus attributed they are my own versions from the
original medi&aelig;val poems.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE writer who would tell again for people of the

delighted the folk of the thirteenth and fourteenth

mass of material ready to his hand. Unless he exercises
a wise discrimination and has some system of
selection, he becomes lost in the mazes of as enchanted
a land,</p>

<p>as ever bewildered knights of old in days of romance.
Down all the dimly lighted pathways of medi&aelig;val literature
mystical figures beckon him in every direction;
fairies, goblins, witches, knights and ladies and giants
entice him, and unless, like Theseus of old, he follows
closely his guiding clue, he will find that he reaches
no goal, attains to no clear vision, achieves no quest.
He will remain spell-bound, captivated by the Middle
Ages&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

<span class="i0">&ldquo;The life, the delight, and the sorrow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of troublous and chivalrous years<br /></span>

</div>
</div>

<p>Such a golden clue to guide the modern seeker through
the labyrinths of the medi&aelig;val mind is that which I have
tried to suggest in the title &ldquo;<em>Hero</em>-Myths and Legends
of the British Race&rdquo;&mdash;the pursuit and representation
of the ideal hero as the mind of Britain and of early
and medi&aelig;val England imagined him, together with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg&nbsp;xviii]</a></span>
the study of the characteristics which made this or that
particular person, mythical or legendary, a hero to the
century which sang or wrote about him. The interest
goes deeper when we study, not merely</p>

<div class="poem">

</div>
</div>

<p>but</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Heroes of our island breed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And men and women of our British birth.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a><br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Hero-worship endures for ever while man endures,&rdquo;
wrote Thomas Carlyle, and this fidelity of men to their
admiration for great heroes is one of the surest tokens
by which we can judge of their own character. Such
as the hero is, such will his worshippers be; and the
men who idolised Robin Hood will be found to have
been men who were themselves in revolt against
oppressive law, or who, finding law powerless to prevent
tyranny, glorified the lawless punishment of wrongs
and the bold denunciation of perverted justice. The
warriors who listened to the saga of Beowulf looked on
physical prowess as the best of all heroic qualities, and
the Normans who admired Roland saw in him the ideal
of feudal loyalty. To every age, and to every nation,
there is a peculiar ideal of heroism, and in the popular
legends of each age this ideal may be found.</p>

<p>Again, these legends give not only the hero as he
seemed to his age; they also show the social life, the
virtues and vices, the superstitions and beliefs, of earlier
ages embedded in the tradition, as fossils are found in
the uplifted strata of some ancient ocean-bed. They
have ceased to live; but they remain, tokens of a life
long past. So in the hero-legends of our nation we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg&nbsp;xix]</a></span>
may find traces of the thoughts and religions of our
ancestors many centuries ago; traces which lie close
to one another in these romances, telling of the nations
who came to these Islands of the West, settled, were
conquered and driven away to make room for other
races whose supremacy has been as brief, till all these
superimposed races have blended into one, to form the
British nation, the most widespread race of modern
times. For</p>

England now can boast of unmixed descent, but must

is a compound of many races, with many characteristics;
and if we would understand him, we must seek
the clue to the riddle in early England and Scotland
and Ireland and Wales, while even France adds her

</div>
</div>

<p>Britain, as far as we can trace men in our island,
was first inhabited by cave-men, who have left no
history at all. In the course of ages they passed away
before the Iberians or Ivernians, who came from the
east, and bore a striking resemblance to the Basques.
It may be that some Mongolian tribe, wandering west,
drawn by the instinct which has driven most race-migrations
westward, sent offshoots north and south&mdash;one
to brave the dangers of the sea and inhabit Britain
and Ireland, one to cross the Pyrenees and remain
sheltered in their deep ravines; or it may be that
Basques from the Pyrenees, daring the storms of the
Bay of Biscay in their frail coracles, ventured to the
shores of Britain. Short and dark were these sturdy
voyagers, harsh-featured and long-headed, worshipping
the powers of Nature with mysterious and cruel rites of
human sacrifice, holding beliefs in totems and ancestor-worship
and in the superiority of high descent claimed
through the mother to that claimed through the father.
When the stronger and more civilised Celt came he drove
before him these little dark men, he enslaved their survivors
or wedded their women, and in his turn fell into
slavery to the cruel Druidic religion of his subjects. To
these Iberians, and to the Celtic dread of them, we
probably owe all the stories of dwarfs, goblins, elves,
and earth-gnomes which fill our fairy-tale books; and
if we examine carefully the descriptions of the abodes
of these beings we shall find them not inconsistent with
the earth-dwellings, caves, circle huts, or even with the
burial mounds, of the Iberian race.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg&nbsp;xxi]</a></span>
The race that followed the Iberians, and drove them
out or subdued them, so that they served as slaves where
they had once ruled as lords, was the proud Aryan Celtic
race. Of different tribes, Gaels, Brythons, and Belg&aelig;,
they were all one in spirit, and one in physical feature.</p>

<p>Tall, blue-eyed, with fair or red hair, they overpowered
in every way the diminutive Iberians, and their tattooing,
while it gave them a name which has often been mistaken
for a national designation (Picts, or painted men), made
them dreadful to their enemies in battle, and ferocious-looking
even in time of peace. Their civilisation was
of a much higher type than that of the Iberians; their
weapons, their war-chariots, their mode of life and their
treatment of women, are all so closely similar to that of
the Greeks of Homer that a theory has been advanced
and ably defended, that the Homeric Greeks were really
invading Celts&mdash;Gaelic or Gaulish tribes from the north
of Europe. If it indeed be so, we owe to the Celts a
debt of imperishable culture and civilisation. To them
belongs more especially, in our national amalgam, the
passion for the past, the ardent patriotism, the longing
for spiritual beauty, which raises and relieves the Saxon
materialism.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg&nbsp;xxii]</a></span>
It is almost impossible to overestimate the value of
the Celtic contribution to our national literature and
character: the race that gave us Ossian, and Finn, and
Cuchulain, that sang of the sorrowful love and doom of
Deirdre, that told of the pursuit of Diarmit and Grania,
till every dolmen and cromlech in Ireland was associated
with these lovers; the race that preserved for us</p>

<div class="poem">

<span class="i0">&ldquo;That grey king whose name, a ghost,<br /></span>

</div>
</div>

<p>the King Arthur whose Arthur&rsquo;s Seat overhangs Edinburgh,
whose presence haunts the Lakes, and Wales,
and Cornwall, and the forests of Brittany; the race that
held up for us the image of the Holy Grail&mdash;that race
can claim no small share in the moulding of the modern
Briton.</p>

<p>The Celt, however, had his day of supremacy and
passed: the Roman crushed his power of initiative
and made him helpless and dependent, and the Teuton,
whether as Saxon, Angle, Frisian, or Jute, dwelt in his
homes and ruled as slaves the former owners of the
land. These new-comers were not physically unlike
the Celts whom they dispossessed. Tall and fair, grey-eyed
and sinewy, the Teuton was a hardier, more sturdy
warrior than the Celt: he had not spent centuries of
quiet settlement and imitative civilisation under the
&aelig;gis of Imperial Rome: he had not learnt to love
the arts of peace and he cultivated none but those of
war; he was by choice a warrior and a sailor, a wanderer
to other lands, a plougher of the desolate places
of the &ldquo;vasty deep,&rdquo; yet withal a lover of home, who
trod at times, with bitter longing for his native land, the
thorny paths of exile. To him physical cowardice was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg&nbsp;xxiii]</a></span>
the unforgivable sin, next to treachery to his lord; for
the loyalty of thane to his chieftain was a very deep
and abiding reality to the Anglo-Saxon warrior, and
in the early poems of our English race, love for &ldquo;his
dear lord, his chieftain-friend,&rdquo; takes the place of that
love of woman which other races felt and expressed. A
quiet death bed was the worst end to a man&rsquo;s life, in the
Anglo-Saxon&rsquo;s creed; it was &ldquo;a cow&rsquo;s death,&rdquo; to be
shunned by every means in a man&rsquo;s power; while a
death in fight, victor or vanquished, was a worthy finish
to a warrior&rsquo;s life. There was no fear of death itself
in the English hero&rsquo;s mind, nor of Fate; the former
was the inevitable,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Seeing that Death, a necessary end,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will come when it will come,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a><br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>and the latter a goddess whose decrees must needs
be obeyed with proud submission, but not with meek
acceptance. Perhaps there was little of spiritual insight
in the minds of these Angles and Saxons, little love of
beauty, little care for the amenities of life; but they had
a sturdy loyalty, an uprightness, a brave disregard of
death in the cause of duty, which we can still recognise
in modern Englishmen. To the Saxon belong the tales
where</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">&ldquo;The warrior kings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In height and prowess more than human, strive<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Heroic hymns.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a><br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>When the English (Anglo-Saxons, as we generally call
them) had settled down in England, had united their
warring tribes, and developed a somewhat centralised
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg&nbsp;xxiv]</a></span>
government, their whole national existence was imperilled
by the incursions of the Danes. Kindred folk
to the Anglo-Saxons were these Danes, these Vikings
from Christiania Wik, these Northmen from Norway
or Iceland, whose fame went before them, and the dread
of whom inspired the petition in the old Litany of the
Church, &ldquo;From the fury of the Northmen, good
Lord, deliver us!&rdquo; Their fair hair and blue or grey
eyes, their tall and muscular frames, bore testimony to
their kinship with the races they harried and plundered,
but their spirit was different from that of the conquered
Teutonic tribes. The Viking <em>loved</em> the sea; it was his
summer home, his field of war and profit. To go &ldquo;a-summer-harrying&rdquo;
was the usual employment of the
true Viking, and in the winter only could he enjoy
domestic life and the pleasures of the family circle.
The rapturous fight with the elements, in which the
Northman lived and moved and had his being, gave him
a strain of ruthless cruelty unlike anything in the more
peaceful Anglo-Saxon character: his disregard of death
for himself led to a certain callousness with regard to
human life, and to a certain enjoyment in inflicting
physical anguish. There was an element of Red Indian
ruthlessness in the Viking, which looms large in the
story of the years of Norse ascendancy over Western
Europe. Yet there was also a power of bold and
daring action, of reckless valour, of rapid conception
and execution, which contrasted strongly with the
slower and more placid temperament of the Anglo-Saxon,
and to this Danish strain modern Englishmen
probably owe the power of initiative, the love of adventure,
and the daring action which have made England
the greatest colonising nation on the earth. The
Danish, Norse, or Viking element spread far and wide
in medi&aelig;val Europe&mdash;Iceland, Normandy (Northman&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg&nbsp;xxv]</a></span>
Land), the Isle of Man, the Hebrides, the east of
Ireland, the Danelagh of East Anglia, and the Cumberland
dales all show traces of the conquering Danish
race; and raider after raider came to England and
stayed, until half of our island was Danish, and even
our royal family became for a time one with the royal
line of Denmark. The acceptance of Christianity by
the Danes in England when Guthrum was baptized
rendered much more easy their amalgamation with the
English; but it was not so in Ireland, where the Round
Towers still stand to show (as some authorities hold)
how the terrified native Irish sheltered from the Danish
fury which nearly destroyed the whole fabric of Irish
Christianity. The legends of Ireland, too, are full of
the terror of the men of &ldquo;Lochlann,&rdquo; which is generally
taken to mean Norway; and the great coast cities
of Ireland&mdash;Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Wexford, and
others&mdash;were so entirely Danish that only the decisive
battle of Clontarf, in which the saintly and victorious
Brian Boru was slain, saved Ireland to Christendom
and curbed the power of the heathen invaders.</p>

<p>A second wave of Norse invasion swept over England
at the Norman Conquest, and for a time submerged
the native English population. The chivalrous Norman
knights who followed William of Normandy&rsquo;s sacred
banner, whether from religious zeal or desire of plunder,
were as truly Vikings by race as were the Danes who
settled in the Danelagh. The days when Rolf (Rollo,
or Rou), the Viking chief, won Normandy were not yet
so long gone by that the fierce piratical instincts of his
followers had ceased to influence their descendants:
piety and learning, feudal law and custom, had made
some impression upon the character of the Norman, but
at heart he was still a Northman. The Norman barons
fought for their independence against Duke William
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg&nbsp;xxvi]</a></span>
with all the determination of those Norse chiefs who
would not acknowledge the overlordship of Harold
Fairhair, but fled to colonise Iceland when he made
himself King of Norway. The seafaring instincts which
drove the Vikings to harry other lands in like manner
drove the Normans to piratical plundering up and down
the English Channel, and, when they had settled in
England, led to continual sea-fights in the Channel
between English and French, hardy Kentish and Norman,
or Cornish and Breton, sailors, with a common
strain of fighting blood, and a common love of the sea.</p>

<p>The Norman Conquest of England was but one
instance of Norman activity: Sicily, Italy, Constantinople,
even Antioch, and the Holy Land itself, showed in
time Norman states, Norman laws, Norman civilisation,
and all alike felt the impulse of Norman energy and inspiration.
England lay ready to hand for Norman invasion&mdash;the
hope of peaceable succession to the saintly
Edward the Confessor had to be abandoned by William;
the gradual permeation of sluggish England with Norman
earls, churchmen, courtiers, had been comprehended
and checked by Earl Godwin and his sons (themselves
of Danish race); but there still remained the way of
open war and an appeal to religious zeal; and this way
William took. There was genius as well as statesmanship
in the idea of combining a personal claim to the
throne held by Harold the usurper with a crusading
summons against the schismatic and heretical English,
who refused obedience to the true successor of St. Peter.
The success of the idea was its justification: the success
of the expedition proved the need that England had
of some new leaven to energise the sluggish temperament
of her sons. The Norman Conquest not only
revived and quickened, but unified and solidified the
English nation. The tyranny of the Norman nobles,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg&nbsp;xxvii]</a></span>
held in check at first only by the tyranny of the
Norman king, was the factor in medi&aelig;val English life
that made for a national consciousness; it also helped
the appreciation of the heroism of revolt against tyranny
which is seen in Hereward the Wake, in Robin Hood,
in William of Cloudeslee, and in many other English
hero-rebels; but it gradually led men to a realization of
their own rights as Englishmen. When all men alike
felt themselves sons of England, the days were past
when Norman and Saxon were aliens to each other,
and Norman robber soon became as truly English as
Danish viking, Anglo-Saxon seafarer, or Celtic settler.
Then the full value of the Norman infusion was seen in
quicker intellectual apprehension, nimbler wit, a keener
sense of reverence, a more spiritual piety, a more refined
courtesy, and a more enlightened perception of the value
of law. The materialism of the original Saxon race was
successively modified by many influences, and not least
of these was the Norman Conquest.</p>

<p>From the Norman Conquest onward England has
welcomed men of many nations&mdash;French, Flemings,
Germans, Dutch: men brought by war, by trade, by
love of adventure, by religion; traders, refugees, exiles,
all have found in her a hospitable shelter and a second
home, and all have come to love the &ldquo;grey old
mother&rdquo; that counted them among her sons and grew
to think them her own in very truth.</p>

<p>Geographically, also, we must recognise the admixture
of races in our islands. The farthest western borders
show most strongly the type of man whom we can
imagine the Iberian to have been: Western Ireland, the
Hebrides, Central and South Wales, and Cornwall are
still inhabited by folk of Iberian descent. The blue-eyed
Celt yet dwells in the Highlands and the greater
part of Wales and the Marches&mdash;Hereford and Shropshire,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg&nbsp;xxviii]</a></span>
and as far as Worcestershire and Cheshire; still
the Dales of Cumberland, the Fen Country, East Anglia,
and the Isle of Man show traces of Danish blood, speech,
manners, and customs; still the slow, stolid Saxon inhabits
the lands south of the Thames from Sussex to
Hampshire and Dorset. The Angle has settled permanently
over the Lowlands of Scotland, with the Celt
along the western fringe, and Flemish blood shows its
traces in Pembroke on the one side (&ldquo;Little England
beyond Wales&rdquo;) and in Norfolk on the other.</p>

<p>With all these nations, all these natures, amalgamated
in our own, it is no wonder that the literature of our
isles contains many different ideals of heroism, changing
according to nationality and epoch. Thus the physical
valour of Beowulf is not the same quality as the valour
of Havelok the Dane, though both are heroes of the
strong arm; and the chivalry of Diarmit is not the same
as the chivalry of Roland. Again, religion has its share
in changing the ideals of a nation, and Constantine,
the warrior of the Early English poem of &ldquo;Elene,&rdquo; is
far from being the same in character as the tender-hearted
Constantine of &ldquo;moral Gower&rsquo;s&rdquo; apocryphal
tale. The law-abiding nature of the earliest heroes,
whose obedience to their king and their priest was
absolute, differs almost entirely from the lawlessness of
Gamelyn and Robin Hood, both of whom set church
and king at defiance, and even account it a merit to
revolt from the rule of both. It follows from this that
we shall find our chosen heroes of very different types
and characters; but we shall recognise that each represented
to his own age an ideal of heroism, which that
age loved sufficiently to put into literature, and perpetuate
by the best means in its power. Of many
another hero besides Arthur&mdash;of Barbarossa, of Hiawatha,
even of Napoleon&mdash;has the tradition grown that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[Pg&nbsp;xxix]</a></span>
he is not dead, but has passed away into the deathless
land, whence he shall come again in his own time. As
Tennyson has sung,</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I: BEOWULF</h2>


<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE figure which meets us as we enter on the
study of Heroes of the British Race is one
which appeals to us in a very special way, since
he is the one hero in whose legend we may see the ideals
of our English forefathers before they left their Continental
home to settle in this island. Opinions may
differ as to the date at which the poem of &ldquo;Beowulf&rdquo;
was written, the place in which it was localised, and the
religion of the poet who combined the floating legends
into one epic whole, but all must accept the poem as
embodying the life and feelings of our Forefathers who
dwelt in North Germany on the shores of the North
Sea and of the Baltic. The life depicted, the characters
portrayed, the events described, are such as a simple
warrior race would cherish in tradition and legend as
relics of the life lived by their ancestors in what doubtless
seemed to them the Golden Age. Perhaps stories
of a divine Beowa, hero and ancestor of the English,
became merged in other myths of sun-hero and marsh-demon,
but in any case the stories are now crystallized
around one central human figure, who may even be
considered an historical hero, Beowulf, the thane of
Hygelac, King of the Geats. It is this grand primitive
hero who embodies the ideal of English heroism. Bold
to rashness for himself, prudent for his comrades,
daring, resourceful, knowing no fear, loyal to his king
and his kinsmen, generous in war and in peace, self-sacrificing,
Beowulf stands for all that is best in manhood
in an age of strife. It is fitting that our first
British hero should be physically and mentally strong,
brave to seek danger and brave to look on death and
Fate undaunted, one whose life is a struggle against evil
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg&nbsp;2]</a></span>
forces, and whose death comes in a glorious victory
over the powers of evil, a victory gained for the sake of
others to whom Beowulf feels that he owes protection
and devotion.</p>


<h3>The Story. The Coming and Passing of Scyld</h3>

<p>Once, long ago, the Danish land owned the sway of
a mighty monarch, Scyld Scefing, the founder of a great
dynasty, the Scyldings. This great king Scyld had
come to Denmark in a mysterious manner, since no
man knew whence he sprang. As a babe he drifted
to the Danish shore in a vessel loaded with treasures;
but no man was with him, and there was no token to
show his kindred and race. When Scyld grew up
he increased the power of Denmark and enlarged her
borders; his fame spread far and wide among men, and
his glory shone undimmed until the day when, full of
years and honours, he died, leaving the throne securely
established in his family. Then the sorrowing Danes
restored him to the mysterious ocean from which he
had come to them. Choosing their goodliest ship, they
laid within it the corpse of their departed king, and
heaped around him all their best and choicest treasures,
until the venerable countenance of Scyld looked to
heaven from a bed of gold and jewels; then they set
up, high above his head, his glorious gold-wrought
banner, and left him alone in state. The vessel was
loosed from the shore where the mourning Danes
bewailed their departing king, and drifted slowly away
to the unknown west from which Scyld had sailed to
his now sorrowing people; they watched until it was
lost in the shadows of night and distance, but no man
under heaven knoweth what shore now holds the
vanished Scyld. The descendants of Scyld ruled and
prospered till the days of his great-grandson Hrothgar,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg&nbsp;3]</a></span>
one of a family of four, who can all be identified
historically with various Danish kings and princes.</p>


<h3>Hrothgar&rsquo;s Hall</h3>

<p>Hrothgar was a mighty warrior and conqueror, who
won glory in battle, and whose fame spread wide
among men, so that nobly born warriors, his kinsmen,
were glad to serve as his bodyguard and to fight for
him loyally in strife. So great was Hrothgar&rsquo;s power
that he longed for some outward sign of the magnificence
of his sway; he determined to build a great hall,
in which he could hold feasts and banquets, and could
entertain his warriors and thanes, and visitors from afar.
The hall rose speedily, vast, gloriously adorned, a great
meeting-place for men; for Hrothgar had summoned
all his people to the work, and the walls towered up
high and majestic, ending in pinnacles and gables
resembling the antlers of a stag. At the great feast
which Hrothgar gave first in his new home the minstrels
chanted the glory of the hall, &ldquo;Heorot,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Hart,&rdquo; as the king named it; Hrothgar&rsquo;s desire was well
fulfilled, that he should build the most magnificent of
banquet-halls. Proud were the mighty warriors who
feasted within it, and proud the heart of the king, who
from his high seat on the da&iuml;s saw his brave thanes
carousing at the long tables below him, and the lofty
rafters of the hall rising black into the darkness.</p>


<h3>Grendel</h3>

<p>Day by day the feasting continued, until its noise
and the festal joy of its revellers aroused a mighty
enemy, Grendel, the loathsome fen-monster. This
monstrous being, half-man, half-fiend, dwelt in the
fens near the hill on which Heorot stood. Terrible was
he, dangerous to men, of extraordinary strength, human
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg&nbsp;4]</a></span>
in shape but gigantic of stature, covered with a green
horny skin, on which the sword would not bite. His
race, all sea-monsters, giants, goblins, and evil demons,
were offspring of Cain, outcasts from the mercy of the
Most High, hostile to the human race; and Grendel
was one of mankind&rsquo;s most bitter enemies; hence his
hatred of the joyous shouts from Heorot, and his determination
to stop the feasting.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;This the dire mighty fiend,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>he who in darkness dwelt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suffered with hatred fierce,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>that every day and night<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Sound of harp echoed there,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>and gleeman&rsquo;s sweet song.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus they lived joyously,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>fearing no angry foe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until the hellish fiend<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>wrought them great woe.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Home to his hiding-place,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>bearing his booty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In peace to devour it.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<a name="image_page_4" id="image_page_4"></a>
</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;The demon of evil, with his fierce ravening, greedily
grasped them&rdquo;</p>

<p>When dawn broke, and the Danes from their dwellings
around the hall entered Heorot, great was the
lamentation, and dire the dismay, for thirty noble
champions had vanished, and the blood-stained tracks
of the monster showed but too well the fate that had
overtaken them. Hrothgar&rsquo;s grief was profound, for
he had lost thirty of his dearly loved bodyguard, and
he himself was too old to wage a conflict against the
foe&mdash;a foe who repeated night by night his awful deeds,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg&nbsp;5]</a></span>
in spite of all that valour could do to save the Danes
from his terrible enmity. At last no champion would
face the monster, and the Danes, in despair, deserted
the glorious hall of which they had been so proud.
Useless stood the best of dwellings, for none dared
remain in it, but every evening the Danes left it after
their feast, and slept elsewhere. This affliction endured
for twelve years, and all that time the beautiful hall of
Heorot stood empty when darkness was upon it. By
night the dire fiend visited it in search of prey, and
in the morning his footsteps showed that his deadly
enmity was not yet appeased, but that any effort to use
the hall at night would bring down his fatal wrath on
the careless sleepers.</p>

<p>Far and wide spread the tidings of this terrible
oppression, and many champions came from afar to
offer King Hrothgar their aid, but none was heroic
enough to conquer the monster, and many a mighty
warrior lost his life in a vain struggle against Grendel.
At length even these bold adventurers ceased to come;
Grendel remained master of Heorot, and the Danes
settled down in misery under the bondage of a perpetual
nightly terror, while Hrothgar grew old in helpless
longing for strength to rescue his people from
their foe.</p>


<h3>Beowulf</h3>

<p>Meanwhile there had come to manhood and full
strength a hero destined to make his name famous for
mighty deeds of valour throughout the whole of the
Teutonic North. In the realm of the Geats (G&ouml;taland,
in the south of Sweden) ruled King Hygelac, a mighty
ruler who was ambitious enough to aim at conquering
his neighbours on the mainland of Germany. His
only sister, daughter of the dead king Hrethel, had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg&nbsp;6]</a></span>
married a great noble, Ecgtheow, and they had one son,
Beowulf, who from the age of seven was brought up
at the Geatish court. The boy was a lad of great
stature and handsome appearance, with fair locks and
gallant bearing; but he greatly disappointed his grandfather,
King Hrethel, by his sluggish character. Beowulf
as a youth had been despised by all for his sloth and
his unwarlike disposition; his good-nature and his
rarely stirred wrath made others look upon him with
scorn, and the mighty stature to which he grew brought
him nothing but scoffs and sneers and insults in the
banquet-hall when the royal feasts were held. Yet
wise men might have seen the promise of great strength
in his powerful sinews and his mighty hands, and the
signs of great force of character in the glance of his
clear blue eyes and the fierceness of his anger when he
was once aroused. At least once already Beowulf had
distinguished himself in a great feat&mdash;a swimming-match
with a famous champion, Breca, who had been
beaten in the contest. For this and other victories, and
for the bodily strength which gave Beowulf&rsquo;s hand-grip
the force of thirty men, the hero was already
famed when the news of Grendel&rsquo;s ravages reached
Geatland. Beowulf, eager to try his strength against
the monster, and burning to add to his fame, asked
and obtained permission from his uncle, King Hygelac,
to seek the stricken Danish king and offer his help
against Grendel; then, choosing fourteen loyal comrades
and kinsfolk, he took a cheerful farewell of the
Geatish royal family and sailed for Denmark.</p>

<p>Thus it happened that one day the Warden of the
Coast, riding on his round along the Danish shores,
saw from the white cliffs a strange war-vessel running
in to shore. Her banners were unknown to him, her
crew were strangers and all in war-array, and as the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg&nbsp;7]</a></span>
Warden watched them they ran the ship into a small
creek among the mountainous cliffs, made her fast to a
rock with stout cables, and then landed and put themselves
in readiness for a march. Though there were
fifteen of the strangers and the Warden was alone, he
showed no hesitation, but, riding boldly down into
their midst, loudly demanded:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;What are ye warlike men<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>wielding bright weapons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wearing grey corslets<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>and boar-adorned helmets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who o&rsquo;er the water-paths<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>come with your foaming keel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ploughing the ocean surge?<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>I was appointed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warden of Denmark&rsquo;s shores;<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>watch hold I by the wave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That on this Danish coast<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>no deadly enemy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leading troops over sea<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>should land to injure.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None have here landed yet<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>more frankly coming<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than this fair company:<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>and yet ye answer not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The password of warriors,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>and customs of kinsmen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ne&rsquo;er have mine eyes beheld<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>a mightier warrior,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An earl more lordly, than<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>is he, the chief of you;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He is no common man;<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>if looks belie him not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He is a hero bold,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>worthily weaponed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anon must I know of you<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>kindred and country,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest ye as spies should go<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>free on our Danish soil.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now ye men from afar,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>sailing the surging sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have heard my earnest thought:<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>best is a quick reply,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I may swiftly know<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>whence ye have hither come.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>So the aged Warden sat on his horse, gazing attentively
on the faces of the fifteen strangers, but watching
most carefully the countenance of the leader; for the
mighty stature, the clear glance of command, the goodly
armour, and the lordly air of Beowulf left no doubt as
to who was the chieftain of that little band. When the
questions had been asked the leader of the new-comers
moved forward till his mighty figure stood beside the
Warden&rsquo;s horse, and as he gazed up into the old man&rsquo;s
eyes he answered: &ldquo;We are warriors of the Geats,
members of King Hygelac&rsquo;s bodyguard. My father, well
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg&nbsp;8]</a></span>
known among men of wisdom, was named Ecgtheow,
a wise counsellor who died full of years and famous for
his wisdom, leaving a memory dear to all good men.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;We come to seek thy king<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>Healfdene&rsquo;s glorious son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy nation&rsquo;s noble lord,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>with friendly mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be thou a guardian good<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>to us strangers here!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We have an errand grave<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>to the great Danish king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor will I hidden hold<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>what I intend!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou canst tell if it is<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>truth (as we lately heard)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That some dire enemy,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>deadly in evil deed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cometh in dark of night,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>sateth his secret hate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Worketh through fearsome awe,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>slaughter and shame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I can give Hrothgar bold<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>counsel to conquer him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How he with valiant mind<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>Grendel may vanquish,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If he would ever lose<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>torment of burning care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If bliss shall bloom again<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>and woe shall vanish.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The aged Warden replied: &ldquo;Every bold warrior of
noble mind must recognise the distinction between
words and deeds. I judge by thy speech that you
are all friends to our Danish king; therefore I bid you
go forward, in warlike array, and I myself will guide
you to King Hrothgar; I will also bid my men draw
your vessel up the beach, and make her fast with a
barricade of oars against any high tide. Safe she shall
be until again she bears you to your own land. May
your expedition prove successful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus speaking, he turned his horse&rsquo;s head and led
the way up the steep cliff paths, while the Geats followed
him, resplendent in shining armour, with boar-crests
on their helmets, shields and spears in their
hands, and mighty swords hanging in their belts: a
goodly band were they, as they strode boldly after the
Warden. Anon there appeared a roughly trodden path,
which soon became a stone-paved road, and the way
led on to where the great hall, Heorot, towered aloft,
gleaming white in the sun; very glorious it seemed,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg&nbsp;9]</a></span>
with its pinnacled gables and its carved beams and
rafters, and the Geats gazed at it with admiration
as the Warden of the Coast said: &ldquo;Yonder stands our
monarch&rsquo;s hall, and your way lies clear before you.
May the All-Father keep you safe in the conflict!
Now it is time for me to return; I go to guard our
shores from every foe.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>Hrothgar and Beowulf</h3>

<p>The little band of Geats, in their shining war-gear,
strode along the stone-paved street, their ring-mail
sounding as they went, until they reached the door of
Heorot; and there, setting down their broad shields
and their keen spears against the wall, they prepared
to enter as peaceful guests the great hall of King
Hrothgar. Wulfgar, one of Hrothgar&rsquo;s nobles, met
them at the door and asked whence such a splendid band
of warlike strangers, so well armed and so worthily
equipped, had come. Their heroic bearing betokened
some noble enterprise. Beowulf answered: &ldquo;We are
Hygelac&rsquo;s chosen friends and companions, and I am
Beowulf. To King Hrothgar, thy master, will I tell
mine errand, if the son of Healfdene will allow us to
approach him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wulfgar, impressed by the words and bearing of the
hero, replied: &ldquo;I will announce thy coming to my lord,
and bring back his answer&rdquo;; and then made his way
up the hall to the high seat where Hrothgar sat on
the da&iuml;s amidst his bodyguard of picked champions.
Bowing respectfully, he said:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Here are come travelling<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>over the sea-expanse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Journeying from afar,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>heroes of Geatland.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beowulf is the name<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>of their chief warrior.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is their prayer, my lord,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>that they may speak with thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do not thou give them<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>a hasty refusal!<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg&nbsp;10]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Do not deny them<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>the gladness of converse!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They in their war-gear seem<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>worthy of men&rsquo;s respect.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Noble their chieftain seems,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>he who the warriors<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hither has guided.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>At these words the aged king aroused himself from
the sad reverie into which he had fallen and answered:
&ldquo;I knew him as a boy. Beowulf is the son of Ecgtheow,
who wedded the daughter of the Geat King
Hrethel. His fame has come hither before him; seafarers
have told me that he has the might of thirty
men in his hand-grip. Great joy it is to know of his
coming, for he may save us from the terror of Grendel.
If he succeeds in this, great treasures will I bestow
upon him. Hasten; bring in hither Beowulf and his
kindred thanes, and bid them welcome to the Danish
folk!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wulfgar hurried down the hall to the place where
Beowulf stood with his little band; he led them gladly
to the high seat, so that they stood opposite to Hrothgar,
who looked keenly at the well-equipped troop,
and kindly at its leader. A striking figure was Beowulf
as he stood there in his gleaming ring-mail, with
the mighty sword by his side. It was, however, but
a minute that Hrothgar looked in silence, for with
respectful greeting Beowulf spoke:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Hail to thee, Hrothgar King!<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>Beowulf am I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hygelac&rsquo;s kinsman<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>and loyal companion.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great deeds of valour<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>wrought I in my youth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To me in my native land<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>Grendel&rsquo;s ill-doing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came as an oft-heard tale<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>told by our sailors.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They say that this bright hall,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>noblest of buildings,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">After the evening-light<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>fails in the heavens.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus, Hrothgar, ancient king,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>all my friends urged me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warriors and prudent thanes,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>that I should seek thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since they themselves had known<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>my might in battle.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg&nbsp;11]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Now I will beg of thee,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>lord of the glorious Danes,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Through his mad recklessness<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>scorns to use weapons;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore will I forego<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>(so may King Hygelac,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That I should bear my sword<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>and my broad yellow shield<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the conflict:<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>with my hand-grip alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I &rsquo;gainst the foe will strive,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>and struggle for my life&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He shall endure God&rsquo;s doom<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>whom death shall bear away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know that he thinketh<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>in this hall of conflict<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fearless to eat me,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>if he can compass it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he has oft devoured<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>heroes of Denmark.<br /></span>

</div>
</div>

<p>The aged King Hrothgar, who had listened attentively
while the hero spoke of his plans and of his
possible fate, now greeted him saying: &ldquo;Thou hast
sought my court for honour and for friendship&rsquo;s sake,
O Beowulf: thou hast remembered the ancient alliance
between Ecgtheow, thy father, and myself, when I
shielded him, a fugitive, from the wrath of the Wilfings,
paid them the due wergild for his crime, and
took his oath of loyalty to myself. Long ago that
time is; Ecgtheow is dead, and I am old and in
misery. It were too long now to tell of all the woe
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg&nbsp;12]</a></span>
that Grendel has wrought, but this I may say, that
many a hero has boasted of the great valour he would
display in strife with the monster, and has awaited his
coming in this hall; in the morning there has been no
trace of each hero but the dark blood-stains on benches
and tables. How many times has that happened!
But sit down now to the banquet and tell thy plans, if
such be thy will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thereupon room was made for the Geat warriors
on the long benches, and Beowulf sat in the place of
honour opposite to the king: great respect was shown
to him, and all men looked with wonder on this mighty
hero, whose courage led him to hazard this terrible
combat. Great carved horns of ale were borne to
Beowulf and his men, savoury meat was placed before
them, and while they ate and drank the minstrels
played and sang to the harp the deeds of men of old.
The mirth of the feast was redoubled now men hoped
that a deliverer had come indeed.</p>


<h3>The Quarrel</h3>

<p>Among all the Danes who were rejoicing over Beowulf&rsquo;s
coming there was one whose heart was sad and
his brow gloomy&mdash;one thane whom jealousy urged to
hate any man more distinguished than himself. Hunferth,
King Hrothgar&rsquo;s orator and speech-maker, from
his official post at Hrothgar&rsquo;s feet watched Beowulf
with scornful and jealous eyes. He waited until a pause
came in the clamour of the feast, and suddenly spoke,
coldly and contemptuously: &ldquo;Art thou that Beowulf
who strove against Breca, the son of Beanstan, when
ye two held a swimming contest in the ocean and
risked your lives in the deep waters? In vain all
your friends urged you to forbear&mdash;ye would go on
the hazardous journey; ye plunged in, buffeting the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg&nbsp;13]</a></span>
wintry waves through the rising storm. Seven days
and nights ye toiled, but Breca overcame thee: he had
greater strength and courage. Him the ocean bore to
shore, and thence he sought his native land, and the
fair city where he ruled as lord and chieftain. Fully
he performed his boast against thee. So I now look
for a worse issue for thee, for thou wilt find Grendel
fiercer in battle than was Breca, if thou darest await
him this night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beowulf&rsquo;s brow flushed with anger as he replied
haughtily: &ldquo;Much hast thou spoken, friend Hunferth,
concerning Breca and our swimming contest; but belike
thou art drunken, for wrongly hast thou told the tale.
A youthful folly of ours it was, when we two boasted
and challenged each other to risk our lives in the
ocean; that indeed we did. Naked swords we bore in
our hands as we swam, to defend ourselves against the
sea-monsters, and we floated together, neither outdistancing
the other, for five days, when a storm drove us
apart. Cold were the surging waves, bitter the north
wind, rough was the swelling flood, under the darkening
shades of night. Yet this was not the worst: the
sea-monsters, excited by the raging tempest, rushed
at me with their deadly tusks and bore me to the
abyss. Well was it then for me that I wore my well-woven
ring-mail, and had my keen sword in hand;
with point and edge I fought the deadly beasts, and
killed them. Many a time the hosts of monsters bore
me to the ocean-bottom, but I slew numbers among
them, and thus we battled all the night, until in the
morning came light from the east, and I could see the
windy cliffs along the shore, and the bodies of the
slain sea-beasts floating on the surge. Nine there
were of them, for Wyrd is gracious to the man who
is valiant and unafraid. Never have I heard of a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg&nbsp;14]</a></span>
sterner conflict, nor a more unhappy warrior lost in
the waters; yet I saved my life, and landed on the
shores of Finland. Breca wrought not so mightily
as I, nor have I heard of such warlike deeds on thy
part, even though thou, O Hunferth, didst murder
thy brothers and nearest kinsmen.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Truly I say to thee,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>O son of Ecglaf bold,<br /></span>

</div>

<p class="caption">Beowulf replies haughtily to Hunferth</p>

<p>Very wroth was Hunferth over the reminder of his
former wrongdoing and the implied accusation of
cowardice, but he had brought it on himself by his
unwise belittling of Beowulf&rsquo;s feat, and the applause
of both Danes and Geats showed him that he dared no
further attack the champion; he had to endure in silence
Beowulf&rsquo;s boast that he and his Geats would that night
await Grendel in the hall, and surprise him terribly,
since the fiend had ceased to expect any resistance from
the warlike Danes. The feast continued, with laughter
and melody, with song and boast, until the door from the
women&rsquo;s bower, in the upper end of the hall, opened
suddenly, and Hrothgar&rsquo;s wife, the fair and gracious
Queen Wealhtheow, entered. The tumult lulled for a
short space, and the queen, pouring mead into a goblet,
presented it to her husband; joyfully he received
and drank it. Then she poured mead or ale for each
man, and in due course came to Beowulf, as to the
guest of honour. Gratefully Wealhtheow greeted the
lordly hero, and thanked him for the friendship which
brought him to Denmark to risk his life against
Grendel. Beowulf, rising respectfully and taking the
cup from the queen&rsquo;s hand, said with dignity:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg&nbsp;15]</a></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;This I considered well<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>when I the ocean sought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sailed in the sea-vessel<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>with my brave warriors,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I alone would win<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>thy folk&rsquo;s deliverance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or in the fight would fall<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>fast in the demon&rsquo;s grip.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Needs must I now perform<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>knightly deeds in this hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or here must meet my doom<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>in darksome night.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Well pleased, Queen Wealhtheow went to sit beside
her lord, where her gracious smile cheered the assembly.
Then the clamour of the feast was renewed, until
Hrothgar at length gave the signal for retiring. Indeed,
it was necessary to leave Heorot when darkness
fell, for the fiend came each night when sunlight faded.
So the whole assembly arose, each man bade his comrades
&ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; and the Danes dispersed; but
Hrothgar addressed Beowulf half joyfully, half sadly,
saying:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Never before have I<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>since I held spear and shield<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Given o&rsquo;er to any man<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>this mighty Danish hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save now to thee alone.<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>Keep thou and well defend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This best of banquet-halls.<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>Show forth thy hero-strength,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Call up thy bravery,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>watch for the enemy!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt not lack gifts of worth<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>if thou alive remain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Winner in this dire strife.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Thus Hrothgar departed, to seek slumber in a less
dangerous abode, where, greatly troubled in mind, he
awaited the dawn with almost hopeless expectation,
and Beowulf and his men prepared themselves for the
perils of the night.</p>


<h3>Beowulf and Grendel</h3>

<p>The fourteen champions of the Geats now made
ready for sleep; but while the others lay down in their
armour, with weapons by their sides, Beowulf took off
his mail, unbelted his sword, unhelmed himself, and
gave his sword to a thane to bear away. For, as he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg&nbsp;16]</a></span>
said to his men, &ldquo;I will strive against this fiend weaponless.
With no armour, since he wears none, will I wrestle
with him, and try to overcome him. I will conquer,
if I win, by my hand-grip alone; and the All-Father
shall judge between us, and grant the victory to whom
He will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Geats then lay down&mdash;brave men who slept
calmly, though they knew they were risking their lives,
for none of them expected to see the light of day again,
or to revisit their native land: they had heard, too,
much during the feast of the slaughter which Grendel
had wrought. So night came, the voices of men grew
silent, and the darkness shrouded all alike&mdash;calm
sleepers, anxious watchers, and the deadly, creeping foe.</p>

<p>When everything was still Grendel came. From
the fen-fastnesses, by marshy tracts, through mists and
swamp-born fogs, the hideous monster made his way to
the house he hated so bitterly. Grendel strode fiercely
to the door of Heorot, and would fain have opened it
as usual, but it was locked and bolted. Then the fiend&rsquo;s
wrath was roused; he grasped the door with his mighty
hands and burst it in. As he entered he seemed to
fill the hall with his monstrous shadow, and from his
eyes shone a green and uncanny light, which showed
him a troop of warriors lying asleep in their war-gear;
it seemed that all slept, and the fiend did not notice
that one man half rose, leaning on his elbow and
peering keenly into the gloom. Grendel hastily put
forth his terrible scaly hand and seized one hapless
sleeper. Tearing him limb from limb, so swiftly that
his cry of agony was unheard, he drank the warm blood
and devoured the flesh; then, excited by the hideous
food, he reached forth again. Great was Grendel&rsquo;s
amazement to find that his hand was seized in a grasp
such as he had never felt before, and to know that he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg&nbsp;17]</a></span>
had at last found an antagonist whom even he must
fight warily. Beowulf sprang from his couch as the
terrible claws of the monster fell upon him, and
wrestled with Grendel in the darkness and gloom of
the unlighted hall, where the flicker of the fire had
died down to a dim glow in the dull embers. That
was a dreadful struggle, as the combatants, in deadly
conflict, swayed up and down the hall, overturning
tables and benches, trampling underfoot dishes and
goblets in the darkling wrestle for life. The men of
the Geats felt for their weapons, but they could not
see the combatants distinctly, though they heard the
panting and the trampling movements, and occasionally
caught a gleam from the fiend&rsquo;s eyes as his face
was turned towards them. When they struck their
weapons glanced harmlessly off Grendel&rsquo;s scaly hide.
The struggle continued for some time, and the hall
was an utter wreck within, when Grendel, worsted for
once, tried to break away and rush out into the night;
but Beowulf held him fast in the grip which no man on
earth could equal or endure, and the monster writhed
in anguish as he vainly strove to free himself&mdash;vainly,
for Beowulf would not loose his grip. Suddenly,
with one great cry, Grendel wrenched himself free, and
staggered to the door, leaving behind a terrible blood-trail,
for his arm and shoulder were torn off and left
in the victor&rsquo;s grasp. So the monster fled wailing
over the moors to his home in the gloomy mere, and
Beowulf sank panting on a shattered seat, scarce believing
in his victory, until his men gathered round,
bringing a lighted torch, by the flaring gleam of which
the green, scaly arm of Grendel looked ghastly and
threatening. But the monster had fled, and after such
a wound as the loss of his arm and shoulder must
surely die; therefore the Geats raised a shout of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg&nbsp;18]</a></span>
triumph, and then took the hateful trophy and fastened
it high up on the roof of the hall, that all who entered
might see the token of victory and recognise that the
Geat hero had performed his boast, that he would conquer
with no weapon, but by the strength of his hands
alone.</p>

<p>In the morning many a warrior came to Heorot to
learn the events of the night, and all saw the grisly
trophy, praised Beowulf&rsquo;s might and courage, and
followed with eager curiosity the blood-stained track of
the fleeing demon till it came to the brink of the
gloomy lake, where it disappeared, though the waters
were stained with gore, and boiled and surged with
endless commotion. There on the shore the Danes
rejoiced over the death of their enemy, and returned to
Heorot care-free and glad at heart. Meanwhile Beowulf
and his Geats stayed in Heorot, for Hrothgar had not
yet come to receive an account of their night-watch.
Throughout the day there was feasting and rejoicing,
with horse-races, and wrestling, and manly contests of
skill and endurance; or the Danes collected around
the bard as he chanted the glory of Sigmund and his
son Fitela. Then came King Hrothgar himself, with
his queen and her maiden train, and they paused to
gaze with horror on the dreadful trophy, and to turn
with gratitude to the hero who had delivered them
from this evil spirit. Hrothgar said: &ldquo;Thanks be to
the All-Father for this happy sight! Much sorrow
have I endured at the hands of Grendel, many warriors
have I lost, many uncounted years of misery have I
lived, but now my woe has an end! Now a youth
has performed, with his unaided strength, what all we
could not compass with our craft! Well might thy
father, O Beowulf, rejoice in thy fame! Well may
thy mother, if she yet lives, praise the All-Father for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg&nbsp;19]</a></span>
the noble son she bore! A son indeed shalt thou be
to me in love, and nothing thou desirest shalt thou
lack, that I can give thee. Often have I rewarded less
heroic deeds with great gifts, and to thee I can deny
nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beowulf answered: &ldquo;We have performed our
boast, O King, and have driven away the enemy. I
intended to force him down on one of the beds, and
to deprive him of his life by mere strength of my
hand-grip, but in this I did not succeed, for Grendel
escaped from the hall. Yet he left here with me his
hand, his arm, and shoulder as a token of his presence,
and as the ransom with which he bought off the rest
of his loathsome body; yet none the longer will he
live thereby, since he bears with him so deadly a
wound.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the hall was cleared of the traces of the conflict
and hasty preparation was made for a splendid banquet.
There was joy in Heorot. The Danes assembled once
again free from fear in their splendid hall, the walls
were hung with gold-wrought embroideries and hangings
of costly stuffs, while richly chased goblets shone
on the long tables, and men&rsquo;s tongues waxed loud as
they discussed and described the heroic struggle of the
night before. Beowulf and King Hrothgar sat on the
high seats opposite to each other, and their men, Danes
and Geats, sitting side by side, shouted and cheered and
drank deeply to the fame of Beowulf. The minstrels
sang of the Fight in Finnsburg and the deeds of Finn
and Hn&aelig;f, of Hengest and Queen Hildeburh. Long
was the chant, and it roused the national pride of the
Danes to hear of the victory of their Danish forefathers
over Finn of the Frisians; and merrily the
banquet went forward, gladdened still more by the
presence of Queen Wealhtheow. Now Hrothgar
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg&nbsp;20]</a></span>
showed his lavish generosity and his thankfulness by
the gifts with which he loaded the Geat chief; and not
only Beowulf, but every man of the little troop. Beowulf
received a gold-embroidered banner, a magnificent
sword, helmet, and corslet, a goblet of gold, and eight
fleet steeds. On the back of the best was strapped a
cunningly wrought saddle, Hrothgar&rsquo;s own, with gold
ornaments. When the Geat hero had thanked the
king fittingly, Queen Wealhtheow arose from her seat,
and, lifting the great drinking-cup, offered it to her
lord, saying:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Take thou this goblet,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>my lord and my ruler,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O giver of treasure,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>O gold-friend of heroes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And speak to the Geats<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>fair speeches of kindness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be mirthful and joyous,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>for so should a man be!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the Geats be gracious,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>mindful of presents<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now that from far and near<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>thou hast firm peace!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tidings have come to me<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>that thou for son wilt take<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This mighty warrior<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>who has cleansed Heorot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brightest of banquet-halls!<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>Enjoy while thou mayest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These manifold pleasures,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>and leave to thy kinsmen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy lands and thy lordships<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>when thou must journey forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To meet thy death.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Turning to Beowulf, the queen said: &ldquo;Enjoy
thy reward, O dear Beowulf, while thou canst, and
live noble and blessed! Keep well thy widespread
fame, and be a friend to my sons in time to come,
should they ever need a protector.&rdquo; Then she gave
him two golden armlets, set with jewels, costly rings, a
corslet of chain-mail and a wonderful jewelled collar of
exquisite ancient workmanship, and, bidding them continue
their feasting, with her maidens she left the hall.
The feast went on till Hrothgar also departed to his
dwelling, and left the Danes, now secure and careless,
to prepare their beds, place each warrior&rsquo;s shield at the
head, and go to sleep in their armour ready for an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg&nbsp;21]</a></span>
alarm. Meanwhile Beowulf and the Geats were joyfully
escorted to another lodging, where they slept
soundly without disturbance.</p>


<h3>Grendel&rsquo;s Mother</h3>

<p>In the darkness of the night an avenger came to
Heorot, came in silence and mystery as Grendel had
done, with thoughts of murder and hatred raging in her
heart. Grendel had gone home to die, but his mother,
a fiend scarcely less terrible than her son, yet lived to
avenge his death. She arose from her dwelling in the
gloomy lake, followed the fen paths and moorland
ways to Heorot, and opened the door. There was a
horrible panic when her presence became known, and
men ran hither and thither vainly seeking to attack
her; yet there was less terror among them than
before when they saw the figure of a horrible woman.
In spite of all, the monster seized Aschere, one of
King Hrothgar&rsquo;s thanes, and bore him away to the
fens, leaving a house of lamentation where men had
feasted so joyously a few hours before. The news was
brought to King Hrothgar, who bitterly lamented the
loss of his wisest and dearest counsellor, and bade
them call Beowulf to him, since he alone could help in
this extremity. When Beowulf stood before the king
he courteously inquired if his rest had been peaceful.
Hrothgar answered mournfully: &ldquo;Ask me not of
peace, for care is renewed in Heorot. Dead is
Aschere, my best counsellor and friend, the truest of
comrades in fight and in council. Such as Aschere
was should a true vassal be! A deadly fiend has
slain him in Heorot, and I know not whither she has
carried his lifeless body. This is doubtless her vengeance
for thy slaying of Grendel; he is dead, and his
kinswoman has come to avenge him.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg&nbsp;22]</a></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;I have heard it reported<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>by some of my people<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That they have looked on<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>two such unearthly ones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Huge-bodied march-striders<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>holding the moor wastes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One of them seemed to be<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>shaped like a woman,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But know not his father<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>nor aught of his kindred.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus these dire monsters<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>dwell in the secret lands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Haunt the hills loved by wolves,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>the windy nesses,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Sinks in the sombre earth.<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>Not far remote from us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Standeth the gloomy mere,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>round whose shores cluster<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Groves with their branches mossed,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>hoary with lichens grey<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wood firmly rooted<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>o&rsquo;ershadows the water.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is a wonder seen<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>nightly by wanderers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flame in the waterflood:<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>liveth there none of men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ancient or wise enough<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>to know its bottom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though the poor stag may be<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>hard by the hounds pursued,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though he may seek the wood,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>chased by his cruel foes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet will he yield his life<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>to hunters on the brink<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere he will hide his head<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>in the dark waters.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&rsquo;Tis an uncanny place.<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>Thence the surge swelleth up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dark to the heavens above,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>when the wind stirreth oft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Terrible driving storms,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>till the air darkens,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The skies fall to weeping.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then Hrothgar burst forth in uncontrollable emotion:
&ldquo;O Beowulf, help us if thou canst! Help is
only to be found in thee. But yet thou knowest not
the dangerous place thou must needs explore if thou
seek the fiend in her den. I will richly reward thy valour
if thou returnest alive from this hazardous journey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beowulf was touched by the sorrow of the grey-haired
king, and replied:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Grieve not, O prudent King!<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>Better it is for each<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he avenge his friend,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>than that he mourn him much.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each man must undergo<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>death at the end of life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let him win while he may<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>warlike fame in the world!<br /></span>

</div>

&ldquo;Arise, my lord; let us scan the track left by the
monster, for I promise thee I will never lose it, wheresoever
it may lead me. Only have patience yet for
this one day of misery, as I am sure thou wilt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hrothgar sprang up joyously, almost youthfully,
and ordered his horse to be saddled; then, with Beowulf
beside him, and a mixed throng of Geats and
Danes following, he rode away towards the home
of the monsters, the dread lake which all men
shunned. The blood-stained tracks were easy to see,
and the avengers moved on swiftly till they came to
the edge of the mere, and there, with grief and horror,
saw the head of Aschere lying on the bank.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The lake boiled with blood,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>with hot welling gore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The warriors gazed awe-struck,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>and the dread horn sang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From time to time fiercely<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>eager defiance.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The warriors sat down there,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>and saw on the water<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sea-dragons swimming<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>to search the abysses.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The blast of the war-horn.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>As Beowulf stood on the shore and watched the uncouth
sea-creatures, serpents, nicors, monstrous beasts
of all kinds, he suddenly drew his bow and shot one of
them to the heart. The rest darted furiously away, and
the thanes were able to drag the carcase of the slain
beast on shore, where they surveyed it with wonder.</p>


<h3>The Fight with Grendel&rsquo;s Mother</h3>

<p>Meanwhile Beowulf had made ready for his task.
He trusted to his well-woven mail, the corslet fitting
closely to his body and protecting his breast, the shining
helm guarding his head, bright with the boar-image
on the crest, and the mighty sword Hrunting,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg&nbsp;24]</a></span>
which Hunferth, his jealousy forgotten in admiration,
pressed on the adventurous hero.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;That sword was called Hrunting,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>an ancient heritage.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Steel was the blade itself,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>tempered with poison-twigs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hardened with battle-blood:<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>never in fight it failed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Any who wielded it,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>when he would wage a strife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the dire battlefield,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>folk-moot of enemies.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>When Beowulf stood ready with naked sword in
hand, he turned and looked at his loyal followers, his
friendly hosts, the grey old King Hrothgar, the sun
and the green earth, which he might never see again;
but it was with no trace of weakness or fear that he
spoke:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Forget not, O noble<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>kinsman of Healfdene,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A worthy protector<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>should death o&rsquo;ertake me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do thou, dear Hrothgar,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>send all these treasures here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which thou hast given me,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>to my king, Hygelac.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then may the Geat king,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>brave son of Hrethel dead,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With Hrunting, noble brand,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>or death shall take me.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Beowulf dived downward, as it seemed to him, for
the space of a day ere he could perceive the floor of
that sinister lake, and all that time he had to fight the
sea-beasts, for they, attacking him with tusk and horn,
strove to break his ring-mail, but in vain. As Beowulf
came near the bottom he felt himself seized in
long, scaly arms of gigantic strength. The fierce claws
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg&nbsp;25]</a></span>
of the wolfish sea-woman strove eagerly to reach his
heart through his mail, but in vain; so the she-wolf
of the waters, a being awful and loathsome, bore him
to her abode, rushing through thick clusters of horrible
sea-beasts.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The hero now noticed<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>he was in some hostile hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where him the water-stream<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>no whit might injure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor for the sheltering roof<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>the rush of the raging flood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ever could touch him.<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>He saw the strange flickering flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weird lights in the water,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>shining with livid sheen:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw, too, the ocean-wolf,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>the hateful sea-woman.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Terrible and almost superhuman was the contest
which now followed: the awful sea-woman flung Beowulf
down on his back and stabbed at him with point
and edge of her broad knife, seeking some vulnerable
point; but the good corslet resisted all her efforts, and
Beowulf, exerting his mighty force, overthrew her and
sprang to his feet. Angered beyond measure, he
brandished the flaming sword Hrunting, and flashed
one great blow at her head which would have killed
her had her scales and hair been vulnerable; but alas!
the edge of the blade turned on her scaly hide, and the
blow failed. Wrathfully Beowulf cast aside the useless
sword, and determined to trust once again to his hand-grip.
Grendel&rsquo;s mother now felt, in her turn, the
deadly power of Beowulf&rsquo;s grasp, and was borne to
the ground; but the struggle continued long, for Beowulf
was weaponless, since the sword failed in its work.
Yet some weapon he must have.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;So he gazed at the walls,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>saw there a glorious sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An old brand gigantic,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>trusty in point and edge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An heirloom of heroes;<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>that was the best of blades,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Splendid and stately,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>the forging of giants;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But it was huger than<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>any of human race<br /></span>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg&nbsp;26]</a></span>
This mighty sword, a relic of earlier and greater
races, brought new hope to Beowulf. Springing up, he
snatched it from the wall and swung it fiercely round
his head. The blow fell with crushing force on the
neck of the sea-woman, the dread wolf of the abyss,
and broke the bones. Dead the monster sank to the
ground, and Beowulf, standing erect, saw at his feet
the lifeless carcase of his foe. The hero still grasped
his sword and looked warily along the walls of the
water-dwelling, lest some other foe should emerge
from its recesses; but as he gazed Beowulf saw his
former foe, Grendel, lying dead on a bed in some
inner hall. He strode thither, and, seizing the corpse
by the hideous coiled locks, shore off the head to carry
to earth again. The poisonous hot blood of the
monster melted the blade of the mighty sword, and
nothing remained but the hilt, wrought with curious
ornaments and signs of old time. This hilt and Grendel&rsquo;s
head were all that Beowulf carried off from the water-fiends&rsquo;
dwelling; and laden with these the hero sprang
up through the now clear and sparkling water.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">Beowulf shears off the head of Grendel</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Danes and Geats had waited long
for his reappearance. When the afternoon was well
advanced the Danes departed sadly, lamenting the
hero&rsquo;s death, for they concluded no man could have
survived so long beneath the waters; but his loyal
Geats sat there still gazing sadly at the waves, and
hoping against all hope that Beowulf would reappear.
At length they saw changes in the mere&mdash;the blood
boiling upwards in the lake, the quenching of the unholy
light, then the flight of the sea-monsters and a
gradual clearing of the waters, through which at last
they could see their lord uprising. How gladly
they greeted him! What awe and wonder seized
them as they surveyed his dreadful booty, the ghastly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg&nbsp;27]</a></span>
head of Grendel and the massive hilt of the gigantic
sword! How eagerly they listened to his story, and
how they vied with one another for the glory of bearing
his armour, his spoils, and his weapons back over
the moorlands and the fens to Heorot. It was a
proud and glad troop that followed Beowulf into the
hall, and up through the startled throng until they laid
down before the feet of King Hrothgar the hideous
head of his dead foe, and Beowulf, raising his voice that
all might hear above the buzz and hum of the great
banquet-hall, thus addressed the king:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Lo! we this sea-booty,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>O wise son of Healfdene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lord of the Scyldings, have<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>brought for thy pleasure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In token of triumph,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>as thou here seest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From harm have I hardly<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>escaped with my life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The war under water<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>sustained I with trouble,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The conflict was almost<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>decided against me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If God had not guarded me!<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>Nought could I conquer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Hrunting in battle,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>though &rsquo;tis a doughty blade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the gods granted me<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>that I saw suddenly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hanging high in the hall<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>a bright brand gigantic:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So seized I and swung it<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>that in the strife I slew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lords of the dwelling.<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>The mighty blade melted fast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the hot boiling blood,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>the poisonous battle-gore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the hilt have I here<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>borne from the hostile hall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have avenged the crime,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>the death of the Danish folk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As it behov&egrave;d me.<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>Now can I promise thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thou in Heorot<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>care-free mayest slumber<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all thy warrior-troop<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>and all thy kindred thanes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The young and the aged:<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>thou needst not fear for them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Death from these mortal foes,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>as thou of yore hast done.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>King Hrothgar was now more delighted than ever at
the return of his friend and the slaughter of his foes.
He gazed in delight and wonder at the gory head of
the monster, and the gigantic hilt of the weapon which
struck it off. Then, taking the glorious hilt, and scanning
eagerly the runes which showed its history, as the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg&nbsp;28]</a></span>
tumult stilled in the hall, and all men listened for his
speech, he broke out: &ldquo;Lo! this may any man say,
who maintains truth and right among his people, that
good though he may be this hero is even better! Thy
glory is widespread, Beowulf my friend, among thine
own and many other nations, for thou hast fulfilled all
things by patience and prudence. I will surely perform
what I promised thee, as we agreed before; and
I foretell of thee that thou wilt be long a help and
protection to thy people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>King Hrothgar spoke long and eloquently while all
men listened, for he reminded them of mighty warriors
of old who had not won such glorious fame, and
warned them against pride and lack of generosity and
self-seeking; and then, ending with thanks and fresh
gifts to Beowulf, he bade the feast continue with increased
jubilation. The tumultuous rejoicing lasted
till darkness settled on the land, and when it ended all
retired to rest free from fear, since no more fiendish
monsters would break in upon their slumbers; gladly
and peacefully the night passed, and with the morn
came Beowulf&rsquo;s resolve to return to his king and his
native land.</p>

<p>When Beowulf had come to this decision he went to
Hrothgar and said:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Now we sea-voyagers<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>come hither from afar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must utter our intent<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>to seek King Hygelac.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here were we well received,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>well hast thou treated us.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If on this earth I can<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>do more to win thy love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O prince of warriors,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>than I have wrought as yet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here stand I ready now<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>weapons to wield for thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I shall ever hear<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>o&rsquo;er the encircling flood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That any neighbouring foes<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>threaten thy nation&rsquo;s fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Grendel grim before,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>swift will I bring to thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thousands of noble thanes,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>heroes to help thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know of Hygelac,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>King of the Geat folk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he will strengthen me<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>(though he is young in years)<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg&nbsp;29]</a></span>
<span class="i0">In words and warlike deeds<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>to bear my warrior-spear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the ocean surge,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>when arms would serve thy need,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swift to thine aid.<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>If thy son Hrethric young<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comes to the Geat court,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>there to gain skill in arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then will he surely find<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>many friends waiting him:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Better in distant lands<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>learneth by journeying<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He who is valiant.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Hrothgar was greatly moved by the words of the
Geat hero and his promise of future help. He wondered
to find such wisdom in so young a warrior, and felt
that the Geats could never choose a better king if battle
should cut off the son of Hygelac, and he renewed his
assurance of continual friendship between the two
countries and of enduring personal affection. Finally,
with fresh gifts of treasure and with tears of regret
Hrothgar embraced Beowulf and bade him go speedily
to his ship, since a friend&rsquo;s yearning could not retain him
longer from his native land. So the little troop of Geats
with their gifts and treasures marched proudly to their
vessel and sailed away to Geatland, their dragon-prowed
ship laden with armour and jewels and steeds, tokens
of remembrance and thanks from the grateful Danes.</p>


<h3>Beowulf&rsquo;s Return</h3>

<p>Blithe-hearted were the voyagers, and gaily the ship
danced over the waves, as the Geats strained their
eyes towards the cliffs of their home and the well-known
shores of their country. When their vessel
approached the land the coast-warden came hurrying
to greet them, for he had watched the ocean day and
night for the return of the valiant wanderers. Gladly
he welcomed them, and bade his underlings help to bear
their spoils up to the royal palace, where King Hygelac,
himself young and valiant, awaited his victorious kinsman,
with his beauteous queen, Hygd, beside him.
Then came Beowulf, treading proudly the rocky paths
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg&nbsp;30]</a></span>
to the royal abode, for messengers had gone in advance
to announce to the king his nephew&rsquo;s success, and a
banquet was being prepared, where Beowulf would sit
beside his royal kinsman.</p>

<p>Once more there was a splendid feast, with tumultuous
rejoicing. Again a queenly hand&mdash;that of the beauteous
Hygd&mdash;poured out the first bowl in which to celebrate
the safe return of the victorious hero. And now the
wonderful story of the slaying of the fen-fiends must
be told.</p>

<p>Beowulf was called upon to describe again his perils
and his victories, and told in glowing language of the
grisly monsters and the desperate combats, and of the
boundless gratitude and splendid generosity of the
Danish king, and of his prophecy of lasting friendship between
the Danes and the Geats. Then he concluded:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Thus that great nation&rsquo;s king<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>lived in all noble deeds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of guerdon I failed not,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>of meed for my valour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the wise son of Healfdene<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>gave to me treasures great,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gifts to my heart&rsquo;s desire.<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>These now I bring to thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Offer them lovingly:<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>now are my loyalty<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And service due to thee,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>O hero-king, alone!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Near kinsmen have I few<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>but thee, O Hygelac!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>As the hero showed the treasures with which
Hrothgar had rewarded his courage, he distributed them
generously among his kinsmen and friends, giving his
priceless jewelled collar to Queen Hygd, and his best
steed to King Hygelac, as a true vassal and kinsman
should. So Beowulf resumed his place as Hygelac&rsquo;s
chief warrior and champion, and settled down among
his own people.</p>


<h3>Fifty Years After</h3>

<p>When half a century had passed away, great and
sorrowful changes had taken place in the two kingdoms
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg&nbsp;31]</a></span>
of Denmark and Geatland. Hrothgar was dead, and had
been succeeded by his son Hrethric, and Hygelac had
been slain in a warlike expedition against the Hetware.
In this expedition Beowulf had accompanied Hygelac,
and had done all a warrior could do to save his kinsman
and his king. When he saw his master slain he had
fought his way through the encircling foes to the sea-shore,
where, though sorely wounded, he flung himself
into the sea and swam back to Geatland. There he had
told Queen Hygd of the untimely death of her husband,
and had called on her to assume the regency of the kingdom
for her young son Heardred. Queen Hygd called
an assembly of the Geats, and there, with the full consent
of the nation, offered the crown to Beowulf, the wisest
counsellor and bravest hero among them; but he
refused to accept it, and so swayed the Geats by his
eloquence and his loyalty that they unanimously raised
Heardred to the throne, with Beowulf as his guardian
and protector. When in later years Heardred also
fell before an enemy, Beowulf was again chosen king,
and as he was now the next of kin he accepted the
throne, and ruled long and gloriously over Geatland.
His fame as a warrior kept his country free from invasion,
and his wisdom as a statesman increased its
prosperity and happiness; whilst the vengeance he took
for his kinsman&rsquo;s death fulfilled all ideals of family and
feudal duty held by the men of his time. Beowulf, in
fact, became an ideal king, as he was an ideal warrior
and hero, and he closed his life by an ideal act of self-sacrifice
for the good of his people.</p>


<h3>Beowulf and the Fire-Dragon</h3>

<p>In the fiftieth year of Beowulf&rsquo;s reign a great terror
fell upon the land: terror of a monstrous fire-dragon,
who flew forth by night from his den in the rocks,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg&nbsp;32]</a></span>
lighting up the blackness with his blazing breath, and
burning houses and homesteads, men and cattle, with
the flames from his mouth. The glare from his fiery
scales was like the dawn-glow in the sky, but his passage
left behind it every night a trail of black, charred desolation
to confront the rising sun. Yet the dragon&rsquo;s wrath
was in some way justified, since he had been robbed,
and could not trace the thief. Centuries before
Beowulf&rsquo;s lifetime a mighty family of heroes had
gathered together, by feats of arms, and by long inheritance,
an immense treasure of cups and goblets, of
necklaces and rings, of swords and helmets and armour,
cunningly wrought by magic spells; they had joyed in
their cherished hoard for long years, until all had died
but one, and he survived solitary, miserable, brooding
over the fate of the dearly loved treasure. At last he
caused his servants to make a strong fastness in the
rocks, with cunningly devised entrances, known only to
himself, and thither, with great toil and labour of aged
limbs, he carried and hid the precious treasure. As he
sadly regarded it, and thought of its future fate, he
cried aloud:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Hold thou now fast, O earth,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>now men no longer can,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The treasure of mighty earls.<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>From thee brave men won it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In days that are long gone by,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>but slaughter seized on them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Death fiercely vanquished them,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>each of my warriors,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each one of my people,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>who closed their life-days here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After the joy of earth.<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>None have I sword to wield<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or bring me the goblet,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>the richly wrought vessel.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the true heroes have<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>elsewhere departed!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now must the gilded helm<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>lose its adornments,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For those who polished it<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>sleep in the gloomy grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those who made ready erst<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>war-gear of warriors.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Likewise the battle-sark<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>which in the fight endured<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bites of the keen-edged blades<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>midst the loud crash of shields<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rusts, with its wearer dead.<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>Nor may the woven mail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After the chieftain&rsquo;s death<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>wide with a champion rove.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg&nbsp;33]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Gone is the joy of harp,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>gone is the music&rsquo;s mirth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now the hawk goodly-winged<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>hovers not through the hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor the swift-footed mare<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>tramples the castle court:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Baleful death far has sent<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>all living tribes of men.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>When this solitary survivor of the ancient race died
his hoard remained alone, unknown, untouched, until
at length the fiery dragon, seeking a shelter among the
rocks, found the hidden way to the cave, and, creeping
within, discovered the lofty inner chamber and the
wondrous hoard. For three hundred winters he
brooded over it unchallenged, and then one day a
hunted fugitive, fleeing from the fury of an avenging
chieftain, in like manner found the cave, and the dragon
sleeping on his gold. Terrified almost to death, the
fugitive eagerly seized a marvellously wrought chalice
and bore it stealthily away, feeling sure that such an
offering would appease his lord&rsquo;s wrath and atone for
his offence. But when the dragon awoke he discovered
that he had been robbed, and his keen scent assured
him that some one of mankind was the thief. As he
could not at once see the robber, he crept around the
outside of the barrow snuffing eagerly to find traces of
the spoiler, but it was in vain; then, growing more
wrathful, he flew over the inhabited country, shedding
fiery death from his glowing scales and flaming breath,
while no man dared to face this flying horror of the
night.</p>

<p>The news came to Beowulf that his folk were suffering
and dying, and that no warrior dared to risk his
life in an effort to deliver the land from this deadly
devastation; and although he was now an aged man
he decided to attack the fire-drake. Beowulf knew
that he would not be able to come to hand-grips with
this foe as he had done with Grendel and his mother:
the fiery breath of this dragon was far too deadly, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg&nbsp;34]</a></span>
he must trust to armour for protection. He commanded
men to make a shield entirely of iron, for he knew
that the usual shield of linden-wood would be instantly
burnt up in the dragon&rsquo;s flaming breath. He then
chose with care eleven warriors, picked men of his own
bodyguard, to accompany him in this dangerous quest.
They compelled the unhappy fugitive whose theft had
begun the trouble to act as their guide, and thus they
marched to the lonely spot where the dragon&rsquo;s barrow
stood close to the sea-shore. The guide went unwillingly,
but was forced thereto by his lord, because he
alone knew the way.</p>


<h3>Beowulf Faces Death</h3>

<p>When the little party reached the place they halted
for a time, and Beowulf sat down meditating sadly on
his past life, and on the chances of this great conflict
which he was about to begin. When he had striven
with Grendel, when he had fought against the Hetware,
he had been confident of victory and full of joyous
self-reliance, but now things were changed. Beowulf
was an old man, and there hung over him a sad
foreboding that this would be his last fight, and that
he would rid the land of no more monsters. Wyrd
seemed to threaten him, and a sense of coming woe
lay heavy on his heart as he spoke to his little troop:
&ldquo;Many great fights I had in my youth. How well I
remember them all! I was only seven years old when
King Hrethel took me to bring up, and loved me as
dearly as his own sons, Herebeald, Hathcyn, or my
own dear lord Hygelac. Great was our grief when
Hathcyn, hunting in the forest, slew all unwittingly
his elder brother: greater than ordinary sorrow, because
we could not avenge him on the murderer! It
would have given no joy to Hrethel to see his second
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg&nbsp;35]</a></span>
son killed disgracefully as a murderer! So we endured
the pain till King Hrethel died, borne down by his bitter
loss, and I wept for my protector, my kinsman. Then
Hathcyn died also, slain by the Swedes, and my dear lord
Hygelac came to the throne: he was gracious to me,
a giver of weapons, a generous distributor of treasure,
and I repaid him as much as I could in battle against
his foes. Daghrefn, the Frankish warrior who slew
my king, I sent to his doom with my deadly hand-grip:
he, at least, should not show my lord&rsquo;s armour as
trophy of his prowess. But this fight is different:
here I must use both point and edge, as I was not
wont in my youth: but here too will I, old though I
be, work deeds of valour. I will not give way the
space of one foot, but will meet him here in his own
abode and make all my boasting good. Abide ye
here, ye warriors, for this is not your expedition, nor
the work of any man but me alone; wait till ye know
which is triumphant, for I will win the gold and save
my people, or death shall take me.&rdquo; So saying he
raised his great shield, and, unaccompanied, set his face
to the dark entrance, where a stream, boiling with
strange heat, flowed forth from the cave; so hot was
the air that he stood, unable to advance far for the
suffocating steam and smoke. Angered by his impotence,
Beowulf raised his voice and shouted a furious
defiance to the awesome guardian of the barrow. Thus
aroused, the dragon sprang up, roaring hideously and
flapping his glowing wings together; out from the
recesses of the barrow came his fiery breath, and then
followed the terrible beast himself. Coiling and writhing
he came, with head raised, and scales of burnished
blue and green, glowing with inner heat; from his
nostrils rushed two streams of fiery breath, and his
flaming eyes shot flashes of consuming fire. He half
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg&nbsp;36]</a></span>
flew, half sprang at Beowulf. But the hero did not
retreat one step. His bright sword flashed in the air as he
wounded the beast, but not mortally, striking a mighty
blow on his scaly head. The guardian of the hoard
writhed and was stunned for a moment, and then sprang
at Beowulf, sending forth so dense a cloud of flaming
breath that the hero stood in a mist of fire. So
terrible was the heat that the iron shield glowed red-hot
and the ring-mail on the hero&rsquo;s limbs seared him
as a furnace, and his breast swelled with the keen pain:
so terrible was the fiery cloud that the Geats, seated
some distance away, turned and fled, seeking the cool
shelter of the neighbouring woods, and left their heroic
lord to suffer and die alone.</p>


<h3>Beowulf&rsquo;s Death</h3>

<p>Among the cowardly Geats, however, there was one
who thought it shameful to flee&mdash;Wiglaf, the son of
Weohstan. He was young, but a brave warrior, to
whom Beowulf had shown honour, and on whom he had
showered gifts, for he was a kinsman, and had proved
himself worthy. Now he showed that Beowulf&rsquo;s favour
had been justified, for he seized his shield, of yellow
linden-wood, took his ancient sword in hand, and prepared
to rush to Beowulf&rsquo;s aid. With bitter words
he reproached his cowardly comrades, saying: &ldquo;I remember
how we boasted, as we sat in the mead hall
and drank the foaming ale, as we took gladly the gold
and jewels which our king lavished upon us, that we
would repay him for all his gifts, if ever such need there
were! Now is the need come upon him, and we are
here! Beowulf chose us from all his bodyguard to
help him in this mighty struggle, and we have betrayed
and deserted him, and left him alone against a terrible
foe. Now the day has come when our lord should
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg&nbsp;37]</a></span>
see our valour, and we flee from his side! Up, let us
go and aid him, even while the grim battle-flame flares
around him. God knows that I would rather risk my
body in the fiery cloud than stay here while my king
fights and dies! Not such disloyalty has Beowulf
deserved through his long reign that he should stand
alone in the death-struggle. He and I will die together,
or side by side will we conquer.&rdquo; The youthful warrior
tried in vain to rouse the courage of his companions:
they trembled, and would not move. So Wiglaf,
holding on high his shield, plunged into the fiery cloud
and moved towards his king, crying aloud: &ldquo;Beowulf,
my dear lord, let not thy glory be dimmed. Achieve
this last deed of valour, as thou didst promise in days of
yore, that thy fame should not fall, and I will aid thee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sound of another voice roused the dragon to
greater fury, and again came the fiery cloud, burning
up like straw Wiglaf&rsquo;s linden shield, and torturing both
warriors as they stood behind the iron shield with their
heated armour. But they fought on manfully, and
Beowulf, gathering up his strength, struck the dragon
such a blow on the head that his ancient sword was
shivered to fragments. The dragon, enraged, now
flew at Beowulf and seized him by the neck with his
poisonous fangs, so that the blood gushed out in
streams, and ran down his corslet. Wiglaf was filled
with grief and horror at this dreadful sight, and, leaving
the protection of Beowulf&rsquo;s iron shield, dashed forth at
the dragon, piercing the scaly body in a vital part. At
once the fire began to fade away, and Beowulf, mastering
his anguish, drew his broad knife, and with a last
effort cut the hideous reptile asunder. Then the agony
of the envenomed wound came upon him, and his limbs
burnt and ached with intolerable pain. In growing distress
he staggered to a rough ancient seat, carved out
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg&nbsp;38]</a></span>
of the rock, hard by the door of the barrow. There
he sank down, and Wiglaf laved his brow with water
from the little stream, which boiled and steamed no
longer. Then Beowulf partially recovered himself,
and said: &ldquo;Now I bequeath to thee, my son, the
armour which I also inherited. Fifty years have I
ruled this people in peace, so that none of my neighbours
durst attack us. I have endured and toiled much
on this earth, have held my own justly, have pursued
none with crafty hatred, nor sworn unjust oaths. At all
this may I rejoice now that I lie mortally wounded.
Do thou, O dear Wiglaf, bring forth quickly from the
cave the treasures for which I lose my life, that I may
see them and be glad in my nation&rsquo;s wealth ere I die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thereupon Wiglaf entered the barrow, and was dazed
by the bewildering hoard of costly treasures. Filling
his arms with such a load as he could carry, he hastened
out of the barrow, fearing even then to find his lord dead.
Then he flung down the treasures&mdash;magic armour,
dwarf-wrought swords, carved goblets, flashing gems,
and a golden standard&mdash;at Beowulf&rsquo;s feet, so that the
ancient hero&rsquo;s dying gaze could fall on the hoard he
had won for his people. But Beowulf was now so near
death that he swooned away, till Wiglaf again flung
water over him, and the dying champion roused himself
to say, as he grasped his kinsman&rsquo;s hand and looked
at the glittering heap before him:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;I thank God eternal,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>the great King of Glory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the vast treasures<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>which I here gaze upon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I ere my death-day<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>might for my people<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Win so great wealth.<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>Since I have given my life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou must now look to<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>the needs of the nation;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here dwell I no longer,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>for Destiny calleth me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bid thou my warriors<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>after my funeral pyre<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Build me a burial-cairn<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>high on the sea-cliff&rsquo;s head;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It shall for memory<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>tower up on Hronesness,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg&nbsp;39]</a></span>
<span class="i0">So that the seafarers<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>Beowulf&rsquo;s Barrow<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Wyrd has swept all my kin,<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>all the brave chiefs away!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now must I follow them!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>These last words spoken, Beowulf fell back, and his
soul passed away, to meet the joy reserved for all true
and steadfast spirits. The hero was dead, but amid his
grief Wiglaf yet remembered that the dire monster too
lay dead, and the folk were delivered from the horrible
plague, though at terrible cost! Wiglaf, as he mourned
over his dead lord, resolved that no man should joy in
the treasures for which so grievous a price had been
paid&mdash;the cowards who deserted their king should help
to lay the treasures in his grave and bury them far
from human use and profit. Accordingly, when the
ten faithless dastards ventured out from the shelter of
the wood, and came shamefacedly to the place where
Wiglaf sat, sorrowing, at the head of dead Beowulf,
he stilled their cries of grief with one wave of the hand,
which had still been vainly striving to arouse his king
by gentle touch, and, gazing scornfully at them, he cried:
&ldquo;Lo! well may a truthful man say, seeing you here,
safely in the war-gear and ornaments which our dead
hero gave you, that Beowulf did but throw away his
generous gifts, since all he bought with them was
treachery and cowardice in the day of battle! No need
had Beowulf to boast of his warriors in time of danger!
Yet he alone avenged his people and conquered the
fiend&mdash;I could help him but little in the fray, though I
did what I could: all too few champions thronged
round our hero when his need was sorest. Now are all
the joys of love and loyalty ended; now is all prosperity
gone from our nation, when foreign princes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg&nbsp;40]</a></span>
hear of your flight and the shameless deed of this
day. Better is death to every man than a life of
shame!&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">The death of Beowulf</p>

<p>The Geats stood silent, abashed before the keen
and deserved reproaches of the young hero, and they
lamented the livelong day. None left the shore and
their lord&rsquo;s dead corpse; but one man who rode over
the cliff near by saw the mournful little band, with
Beowulf dead in the midst. This warrior galloped
away to tell the people, saying: &ldquo;Now is our ruler, the
lord of the Geats, stretched dead on the plain, stricken
by the dragon which lies dead beside him; and at his
head sits Wiglaf, son of Weohstan, lamenting his royal
kinsman. Now is the joy and prosperity of our folk
vanished! Now shall our enemies make raids upon
us, for we have none to withstand them! But let us
hasten to bury our king, to bear him royally to his
grave, with mourning and tears of woe.&rdquo; These unhappy
tidings roused the Geats, and they hastened to
see if it were really true, and found all as the messenger
had said, and wondered at the mighty dragon and the
glorious hoard of gold. They feared the monster and
coveted the treasure, but all felt that the command now
lay with Wiglaf. At last Wiglaf roused himself from his
silent grief and said: &ldquo;O men of the Geats, I am not
to blame that our king lies here lifeless. He would
fight the dragon and win the treasure; and these he
has done, though he lost his life therein; yea, and I aided
him all that I might, though it was but little I could do.
Now our dear lord Beowulf bade me greet you from
him, and bid you to make for him, after his funeral
pyre, a great and mighty cairn, even as he was the
most glorious of men in his lifetime. Bring ye all the
treasures, bring quickly a bier, and place thereon our
king&rsquo;s corpse, and let us bear our dear lord to Hronesness,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg&nbsp;41]</a></span>
where his funeral fire shall be kindled, and his
burial cairn built.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Geats, bitterly grieving, fulfilled Wiglaf&rsquo;s commands.
They gathered wood for the fire, and piled
it on the cliff-head; then eight chosen ones brought
thither the treasures, and threw the dragon&rsquo;s body over
the cliff into the sea; then a wain, hung with shields,
was brought to bear the corpse of Beowulf to Hronesness,
where it was solemnly laid on the funeral pile and
consumed to ashes.</p>

<div class="poem">

<span class="i0">&ldquo;There then the Weder Geats<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>wrought for their ruler dead<br /></span>

<h2>CHAPTER II: THE DREAM OF
MAXEN WLEDIG</h2>


<h3>The Position of Constantine</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T would seem that the Emperor Constantine the
Great loomed very large in the eyes of medi&aelig;val
England. Even in Anglo-Saxon times many
legends clustered round his name, so that Cynewulf,
the religious poet of early England, wrote the poem
of &ldquo;Elene&rdquo; mainly on the subject of his conversion.
The story of the Vision of the Holy Cross with the
inscription <i>In hoc signo vinces</i> was inspiring to a poet to
whom the heathen were a living reality, not a distant
abstraction; and Constantine&rsquo;s generosity to the Church
of Rome and its bishop Sylvester added another element
of attraction to his character in the medi&aelig;val mind.
It is hardly surprising that other legends of his conversion
and generosity should have sprung up, which differ
entirely from the earlier and more authentic record.
Thus &ldquo;the moral Gower&rdquo; has preserved for us an
alternative legend of the cause of Constantine&rsquo;s conversion,
which forms a good illustration of the virtue of
pity in the &ldquo;Confessio Amantis.&rdquo; Whence this later
legend sprang we have no knowledge, for nothing in
the known history of Constantine warrants our regarding
him as a disciple of mercy, but its existence shows
that the medi&aelig;val mind was busied with his personality.
Another most interesting proof of his importance to
Britain is given in the following legend of &ldquo;The Dream
of Maxen Wledig,&rdquo; preserved in the &ldquo;Mabinogion.&rdquo;
This belongs to the Welsh patriotic legends, and tends
to glorify the marriage of the British Princess Helena
with the Roman emperor, by representing it as preordained
by Fate. The fact that the hero of the Welsh
saga is the Emperor Maxentius instead of Constantius
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg&nbsp;43]</a></span>
detracts little from the interest of the legend, which is
only one instance of the well-known theme of the lover
led by dream, or vision, or magic glass to the home and
heart of the beloved.</p>


<h3>The Emperor Maxen Wledig</h3>

<p>The Emperor Maxen Wledig was the most powerful
occupant of the throne of the C&aelig;sars who had ever
ruled Europe from the City of the Seven Hills. He
was the most handsome man in his dominions, tall and
strong and skilled in all manly exercises; withal he
was gracious and friendly to all his vassals and tributary
kings, so that he was universally beloved. One day he
announced his wish to go hunting, and was accompanied
on his expedition down the Tiber valley by thirty-two
vassal kings, with whom he enjoyed the sport heartily.
At noon the heat was intense, they were far from Rome,
and all were weary. The emperor proposed a halt, and
they dismounted to take rest. Maxen lay down to
sleep with his head on a shield, and soldiers and attendants
stood around making a shelter for him from the
sun&rsquo;s rays by a roof of shields hung on their spears.
Thus he fell into a sleep so deep that none dared to
awake him. Hours passed by, and still he slumbered, and
still his whole retinue waited impatiently for his awakening.
At length, when the evening shadows began to
lie long and black on the ground, their impatience found
vent in little restless movements of hounds chafing in
their leashes, of spears clashing, of shields dropping
from the weariness of their holders, and horses neighing
and prancing; and then Maxen Wledig awoke suddenly
with a start. &ldquo;Ah, why did you arouse me?&rdquo; he asked
sadly. &ldquo;Lord, your dinner hour is long past&mdash;did you
not know?&rdquo; they said. He shook his head mournfully,
but said no word, and, mounting his horse, turned it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg&nbsp;44]</a></span>
and rode in unbroken silence back to Rome, with his
head sunk on his breast. Behind him rode in dismay
his retinue of kings and tributaries, who knew nothing
of the cause of his sorrowful mood.</p>


<h3>The Emperor&rsquo;s Malady</h3>

<p>From that day the emperor was changed, changed
utterly. He rode no more, he hunted no more, he paid
no heed to the business of the empire, but remained
in seclusion in his own apartments and slept. The
court banquets continued without him, music and song
he refused to hear, and though in his sleep he smiled
and was happy, when he awoke his melancholy could
not be cheered or his gloom lightened. When this
condition of things had continued for more than a week
it was determined that the emperor must be aroused
from this dreadful state of apathy, and his groom of
the chamber, a noble Roman of very high rank&mdash;indeed,
a king, under the emperor&mdash;resolved to make the
endeavour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have evil tidings for you.
The people of Rome are beginning to murmur against
you, because of the change that has come over you.
They say that you are bewitched, that they can get no
answers or decisions from you, and all the affairs of the
empire go to wrack and ruin while you sleep and take
no heed. You have ceased to be their emperor, they
say, and they will cease to be loyal to you.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The Dream of the Emperor</h3>

<p>Then Maxen Wledig roused himself and said to the
noble: &ldquo;Call hither my wisest senators and councillors,
and I will explain the cause of my melancholy, and
perhaps they will be able to give me relief.&rdquo; Accordingly
the senators came together, and the emperor
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg&nbsp;45]</a></span>
ascended his throne, looking so mournful that the
whole Senate grieved for him, and feared lest death
should speedily overtake him. He began to address
them thus:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Senators and Sages of Rome, I have heard that my
people murmur against me, and will rebel if I do not
arouse myself. A terrible fate has fallen upon me, and
I see no way of escape from my misery, unless ye can
find one. It is now more than a week since I went
hunting with my court, and when I was wearied I dismounted
and slept. In my sleep I dreamt, and a vision
cast its spell upon me, so that I feel no happiness unless
I am sleeping, and seem to live only in my dreams.
I thought I was hunting along the Tiber valley, lost my
courtiers, and rode to the head of the valley alone.
There the river flowed forth from a great mountain,
which looked to me the highest in the world; but I
ascended it, and found beyond fair and fertile plains,
far vaster than any in our Italy, with mighty rivers flowing
through the lovely country to the sea. I followed
the course of the greatest river, and reached its mouth,
where a noble port stood on the shores of a sea unknown
to me. In the harbour lay a fleet of well-appointed
ships, and one of these was most beautifully adorned,
its planks covered with gold or silver, and its sails of
silk. As a gangway of carved ivory led to the deck, I
crossed it and entered the vessel, which immediately
sailed out of the harbour into the ocean. The voyage
was not of long duration, for we soon came to land in
a wondrously beautiful island, with scenery of varied
loveliness. This island I traversed, led by some secret
guidance, till I reached its farthest shore, broken by
cliffs and precipices and mountain ranges, while between
the mountains and the sea I saw a fair and fruitful land
traversed by a silvery, winding river, with a castle at its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg&nbsp;46]</a></span>
mouth. My longing drew me to the castle, and when
I came to the gate I entered, for the dwelling stood
open to every man, and such a hall as was therein I
have never seen for splendour, even in Imperial Rome.
The walls were covered with gold, set with precious
gems, the seats were of gold and the tables of silver,
and two fair youths, whom I saw playing chess, used
pieces of gold on a board of silver. Their attire was of
black satin embroidered with gold, and golden circlets
were on their brows. I gazed at the youths for a
moment, and next became aware of an aged man sitting
near them. His carved ivory seat was adorned with
golden eagles, the token of Imperial Rome; his ornaments
on arms and hands and neck were of bright
gold, and he was carving fresh chessmen from a rod of
solid gold. Beside him sat, on a golden chair, a maiden
(the loveliest in the whole world she seemed, and still
seems, to me). White was her inner dress under a golden
overdress, her crown of gold adorned with rubies and
pearls, and a golden girdle encircled her slender waist.
The beauty of her face won my love in that moment,
and I knelt and said: &lsquo;Hail, Empress of Rome!&rsquo; but
as she bent forward from her seat to greet me I awoke.
Now I have no peace and no joy except in sleep, for in
dreams I always see my lady, and in dreams we love
each other and are happy; therefore in dreams will I
live, unless ye can find some way to satisfy my longing
while I wake.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">The dream of the Emperor</p>


<h3>The Quest for the Maiden</h3>

<p>The senators were at first greatly amazed, and then
one of them said: &ldquo;My lord, will you not send out
messengers to seek throughout all your lands for the
maiden in the castle? Let each group of messengers
search for one year, and return at the end of the year
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg&nbsp;47]</a></span>
with tidings. So shall you live in good hope of success
from year to year.&rdquo; The messengers were sent out
accordingly, with wands in their hands and a sleeve tied
on each cap, in token of peace and of an embassy;
but though they searched with all diligence, after three
years three separate embassies had brought back no
news of the mysterious land and the beauteous
maiden.</p>

<p>Then the groom of the chamber said to Maxen
Wledig: &ldquo;My lord, will you not go forth to hunt, as
on the day when you dreamt this enthralling dream?&rdquo;
To this the emperor agreed, and rode to the place in
the valley where he had slept. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my
dream began, and I seemed to follow the river to its
source.&rdquo; Then the groom of the chamber said: &ldquo;Will
you not send messengers to the river&rsquo;s source, my
lord, and bid them follow the track of your dream?&rdquo;
Accordingly thirteen messengers were sent, who followed
the river up until it issued from the highest mountain
they had ever seen. &ldquo;Behold our emperor&rsquo;s dream!&rdquo;
they exclaimed, and they ascended the mountain, and
descended the other side into a most beautiful and
fertile plain, as Maxen Wledig had seen in his dream.
Following the greatest river of all (probably the Rhine),
the ambassadors reached the great seaport on the North
Sea, and found the fleet waiting with one vessel larger
than all the others; and they entered the ship and were
carried to the fair island of Britain. Here they journeyed
westward, and came to the mountainous land of
Snowdon, whence they could see the sacred isle of Mona
(Anglesey) and the fertile land of Arvon lying between
the mountains and the sea. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; said the messengers,
&ldquo;is the land of our master&rsquo;s dream, and in yon fair
castle we shall find the maiden whom our emperor
loves.&rdquo;</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg&nbsp;48]</a></span></p>

<h3>The Finding of the Maiden</h3>

<p>So they went through the lovely land of Arvon to
the castle of Caernarvon, and in that lordly fortress was
the great hall, with the two youths playing chess, the
venerable man carving chessmen, and the maiden in her
chair of gold. When the ambassadors saw the fair
Princess Helena they fell on their knees before her
and said: &ldquo;Empress of Rome, all hail!&rdquo; But Helena
half rose from her seat in anger as she said: &ldquo;What
does this mockery mean? You seem to be men of
gentle breeding, and you wear the badge of messengers:
whence comes it, then, that ye mock me thus?&rdquo; But
the ambassadors calmed her anger, saying: &ldquo;Be not
wroth, lady: this is no mockery, for the Emperor of
Rome, the great lord Maxen Wledig, has seen you in
a dream, and he has sworn to wed none but you.
Which, therefore, will you choose, to accompany us to
Rome, and there be made empress, or to wait here
until the emperor can come to you?&rdquo; The princess
thought deeply for a time, and then replied: &ldquo;I would
not be too credulous, or too hard of belief. If the
emperor loves me and would wed me, let him find me
in my father&rsquo;s house, and make me his bride in my
own home.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The Dream Realized</h3>

<p>After this the thirteen envoys departed, and returned
to the emperor in such haste that when their horses
failed they gave no heed, but took others and pressed
on. When they reached Rome and informed Maxen
Wledig of the success of their mission he at once
gathered his army and marched across Europe towards
Britain. When the Roman emperor had crossed the
sea he conquered Britain from Beli the son of Manogan,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg&nbsp;49]</a></span>
and made his way to Arvon. On entering the castle he
saw first the two youths, Kynon and Adeon, playing
chess, then their father, Eudav, the son of Caradoc,
and then his beloved, the beauteous Helena, daughter
of Eudav. &ldquo;Empress of Rome, all hail!&rdquo; Maxen
Wledig said; and the princess bent forward in her chair
and kissed him, for she knew he was her destined
husband. The next day they were wedded, and the
Emperor Maxen Wledig gave Helena as dowry all
Britain for her father, the son of the gallant Caradoc,
and for herself three castles, Caernarvon, Caerlleon, and
Caermarthen, where she dwelt in turn; and in one of
them was born her son Constantine, the only British-born
Emperor of Rome. To this day in Wales the
old Roman roads that connected Helena&rsquo;s three castles
are known as &ldquo;Sarn Helen.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III: THE STORY OF
CONSTANTINE AND ELENE</h2>


<h3>The Greatness of Constantine Provokes Attack</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N the year 312, the sixth year after Constantine
had become emperor, the Roman Empire had
increased on every hand, for Constantine was a
mighty leader in war, a gracious and friendly lord in
peace; he was a true king and ruler, a protector of all
men. So mightily did he prosper that his enemies
assembled great armies against him, and a confederation
to overthrow him was made by the terrible Huns, the
famous Goths, the brave Franks, and the warlike
Hugas. This powerful confederation sent against
Constantine an overwhelming army of Huns, whose
numbers seemed to be countless, and yet the Hunnish
leaders feared, when they knew that the emperor himself
led the small Roman host.</p>


<h3>The Eve of the Battle</h3>

<p>The night before the battle Constantine lay sadly
in the midst of his army, watching the stars, and dreading
the result of the next day&rsquo;s conflict; for his
warriors were few compared with the Hunnish multitude,
and even Roman discipline and devotion might
not win the day against the mad fury of the barbarous
Huns. At last, wearied out, the emperor slept, and a
vision came to him in his sleep. He seemed to see,
standing by him, a beautiful shining form, a man more
glorious than the sons of men, who, as Constantine
sprang up ready helmed for war, addressed him by
name. The darkness of night fled before the heavenly
light that shone from the angel, and the messenger
said:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg&nbsp;51]</a></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;O Constantinus, the Ruler of Angels,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Lord of all glory, the Master of heaven&rsquo;s hosts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Claims from thee homage. Be not thou affrighted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though armies of aliens array them for battle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though terrible warriors threaten fierce conflict.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look thou to the sky, to the throne of His glory;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There seest thou surely the symbol of conquest.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="author">Elene.</p>


<h3>Vision of the Cross</h3>

<p>Constantine looked up as the angel bade him, and
saw, hovering in the air, a cross, splendid, glorious,
adorned with gems and shining with heavenly light.
On its wood letters were engraved, gleaming with
unearthly radiance:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;With this shalt thou conquer the foe in the conflict,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with it shalt hurl back the host of the heathen.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="author">Elene.</p>


<h3>Constantine is Cheered</h3>

<p>Constantine read these words with awe and gladness,
for indeed he knew not what deity had thus favoured
him, but he would not reject the help of the Unknown
God; so he bowed his head in reverence, and when
he looked again the cross and the angel had disappeared,
and around him as he woke was the greyness of the
rising dawn. The emperor summoned to his tent two
soldiers from the troops, and bade them make a cross
of wood to bear before the army. This they did,
greatly marvelling, and Constantine called a standard-bearer,
to whom he gave charge to bear forward the
Standard of the Cross where the danger was greatest
and the battle most fierce.</p>


<h3>The Morning of Battle</h3>

<p>When the day broke, and the two armies could see
each other, both hosts arrayed themselves for battle,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg&nbsp;52]</a></span>
in serried ranks of armed warriors, shouting their war-cries.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Loud sang the trumpets to stern-minded foemen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dewy-winged eagle watched them march onward,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The horny-billed raven rejoiced in the battle-play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sly wolf, the forest-thief, soon saw his heart&rsquo;s desire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the fierce warriors rushed at each other.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great was the shield-breaking, loud was the clamour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hard were the hand-blows, and dire was the downfall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When first the heroes felt the keen arrow-shower.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon did the Roman host fall on the death-doomed Huns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrust forth their deadly spears over the yellow shields,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Broke with their battle-glaives breasts of the foemen.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="author">Elene.</p>


<h3>The Cross is Raised</h3>

<p>Then, when the battle was at its height, and the
Romans knew not whether they would conquer or die
fighting to the last, the standard-bearer raised the
Cross, the token of promised victory, before all the
host, and sang the chant of triumph. Onward he
marched, and the Roman host followed him, pressing
on resistless as the surging waves. The Huns, bewildered
by the strange rally, and dreading the
mysterious sign of some mighty god, rolled back, at
first slowly, and then more and more quickly, till sullen
retreat became panic rout, and they broke and fled.
Multitudes were cut down as they fled, other multitudes
were swept away by the devouring Danube as
they tried to cross its current; some, half dead,
reached the other side, and saved their lives in
fortresses, guarding the steep cliffs beyond the Danube.
Few, very few they were who ever saw their native land
again.</p>

<p>There was great rejoicing in the Roman army and
in the Roman camp when Constantine returned in
triumph with the wondrous Cross borne before him.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg&nbsp;53]</a></span>
He passed on to the city, and the people of Rome gazed
with awe on the token of the Unknown God who had
saved their city, but none would say who that God
might be.</p>


<h3>A Council Summoned</h3>

<p>The emperor summoned a great council of all the
wisest men in Rome, and when all were met he raised
the Standard of the Cross in the midst and said:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Can any man tell me, by spells or by ancient lore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who is the gracious God, giver of victory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who came in His glory, with the Cross for His token,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who rescued my people and gave me the victory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scattered my foemen and put the fierce Huns to flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Showed me in heaven His sign of deliverance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The loveliest Cross of light, gleaming in glory?&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="author">Elene.</p>

<p>At first no man could give him any answer&mdash;perhaps
none dared&mdash;till after a long silence the wisest of all
arose and said he had heard that the Cross was the sign
of Christ the King of Heaven, and that the knowledge
of His way was only revealed to men in baptism.
When strict search was made some Christians were
found, who preached the way of life to Constantine,
and rejoiced that they might tell before men, of the life
and death, the Resurrection and Ascension of Jesus
Christ, who redeemed mankind from the bonds of
evil; and then Constantine, being fully instructed and
convinced, was baptized and became the first Christian
emperor.</p>


<h3>Constantine Desires to Find our Saviour&rsquo;s Cross</h3>

<p>Constantine&rsquo;s heart, however, was too full of love
for his new Lord to let him rest satisfied without some
visible token of Christ&rsquo;s sojourn on earth. He longed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg&nbsp;54]</a></span>
to have, to keep for his own, one thing at least which
Jesus had touched during His life, and his thoughts
turned chiefly to that Cross which had been to himself
both the sign of triumph and the guide to the way of
life. Thus he again called together his Christian
teachers, and inquired more closely where Christ had
suffered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Jud&aelig;a, outside the walls of Jerusalem, He died
on the Cross,&rdquo; they told him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then there, near that city, so blest and so curst,
we must seek His precious Cross,&rdquo; cried Constantine.</p>


<h3>Summons his Mother Elene</h3>

<p>Forthwith he summoned from Britain his mother
the British Princess Elene, and when she had been
taught the truth, had been converted and baptized, he
told her of his heart&rsquo;s desire, and begged her to journey
to Jerusalem and seek the sacred Cross.</p>

<p>Elene herself, when she heard Constantine&rsquo;s words,
was filled with wonder, and said: &ldquo;Dear son, thy words
have greatly rejoiced my heart, for know that I, too,
have seen a vision, and would gladly seek the Holy
Cross, where it lies hidden from the eyes of men.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>Elene&rsquo;s Vision</h3>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Now will I tell thee the brightest of visions,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dreamt at the midnight when men lay in slumber.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hovering in heaven saw I a radiant Cross,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gloriously gold-adorned, shining in splendour;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Starry gems shone on it at the four corners,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flashed from the shoulder-span five gleaming jewels.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Angels surrounded it, guarding it gladly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet in its loveliness sad was that Cross to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For &rsquo;neath the gold and gems fast blood flowed from it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till it was all defiled with the dark drops.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="author">Dream of the Rood.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg&nbsp;55]</a></span>
In this dream of Elene&rsquo;s the Cross spoke to her,
and told her of the sad fate which had made of that
hapless tree the Cross on which the Redeemer of mankind
had released the souls of men from evil, on which
He had spread out His arms to embrace mankind, had
bowed His head, weary with the strife, and had given
up His soul. All creation wept that hour, for Christ
was on the Cross.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Yet His friends came to him, left not His corpse alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Took down the Mighty King from His sharp sufferings&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Humbly I bowed myself down to the hands of men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sadly they laid Him down in His dark rock-hewn grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sadly they sang for Him dirges for death-doomed ones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sadly they left Him there as His fair corpse grew cold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We, the three Crosses, stood mournful in loneliness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till evil-thinking men felled us all three to ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sank us deep into earth, sealed us from sight of man.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="author">Dream of the Rood.</p>


<h3>She Undertakes the Quest</h3>

<p>As Constantine had been guided by the heavenly
vision of the True Cross, so now Elene would journey
to the land of the Jews and find the reality of that
Holy Cross. Her will and that of her son were one
in this matter, so that before long the whole city resounded
with the bustle and clamour of preparation,
for Elene was to travel with the pomp and retinue
befitting the mother of the Emperor of Rome.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;There by the Wendel Sea stood the wave-horses.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proudly the plunging ships sought out the ocean path.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Line followed after line of the tall brine-ploughs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth went the water-steeds o&rsquo;er the sea-serpent&rsquo;s road<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright shields on the bulwarks oft broke the foaming surge.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ne&rsquo;er saw I lady lead such a fair following!&rdquo;<br /></span>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg&nbsp;56]</a></span></p>

<h3>She Comes to Jud&aelig;a</h3>

<p>Queen Elene had a prosperous voyage, and, after
touching at the land of the Greeks, reached in due
time the country of Jud&aelig;a, and so, with good hope
came to Jerusalem. There, in the emperor&rsquo;s name,
she summoned to an assembly all the oldest and wisest
Jews, a congregation of a thousand venerable rabbis,
learned in all the books of the Law and the Prophets
and proud that they were the Chosen People in a world
of heathens, aliens from the True God. These she
addressed at first with a blending of flattery and reproach&mdash;flattery
for the Chosen People, reproach for
their perversity of wickedness&mdash;and, finally, peremptorily
demanded an answer to any question she might ask
of them. The Jews withdrew and deliberated sadly
whether they durst refuse the request of so mighty a
person as the emperor&rsquo;s mother, and, deciding that
they durst not, returned to the hall where Elene sat in
splendour on her throne and announced their readiness
to reply to all her questions. Elene, however, bade
them first lessen their numbers. They chose five
hundred to reply for them, and on these she poured
such bitter reproaches that they at last exclaimed:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Lady, we learnt of yore laws of the Hebrew folk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which all our fathers learnt from the true ark of God.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lady, we know not now why thou thus blamest us;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How has the Jewish race done grievous wrong to thee?&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="author">Elene.</p>


<h3>She Cross-questions the Rabbis</h3>

<p>Elene only replied: &ldquo;Go ye away, and choose out
from among these five hundred those whose wisdom is
great enough to show them without delay the answer
to all things I require&rdquo;; and again they left her presence.
When they were alone, one of them, named Judas,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg&nbsp;57]</a></span>
said &ldquo;I know what this queen requires: she will
demand to know from us where the Cross is concealed
on which the Lord of the Christians was crucified; but
if we tell this secret I know well that the Jews will
cease to bear rule on the earth, and our holy scriptures
will be forgotten. For my grandfather Zacch&aelig;us, as
he lay dying, bade me confess the truth if ever man
should inquire concerning the Holy Tree; and when I
asked how our nation had failed to recognise the Holy
and Just One, he told me that he had always withdrawn
himself from the evil deeds of his generation, and their
leaders had been blinded by their own unrighteousness,
and had slain the Lord of Glory. And he ended:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Thus I and my father secretly held the Faith.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now warn I thee, my son, speak not thou mockingly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the true Son of God reigning in glory:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For whom my Stephen died, and the Apostle Paul.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="author">Elene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Judas, &ldquo;since things are so, decide ye what
we shall reveal, or what conceal, if this queen asks us.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>One Appointed to Answer her</h3>

<p>The other elders replied: &ldquo;Do what seems to thee
best, since thou alone knowest this. Never have we
heard of these strange secrets. Do thou according to
thy great wisdom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While they still deliberated came the heralds with
silver trumpets, which they blew, proclaiming aloud:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The mighty Queen calls you, O men, to the Council,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That she may hear from you of your decision.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great is the need ye have of all your wisdom.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="author">Elene.</p>

<p>Slowly and reluctantly the Jewish rabbis returned
to the council-chamber, and listened to Elene as she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg&nbsp;58]</a></span>
plied them with questions about the ancient prophecies
and the death of Christ; but to all her inquiries they
professed entire ignorance, until, in her wrath, the queen
threatened them with death by fire. Then they led
forward Judas, saying: &ldquo;He can reveal the mysteries of
Fate, for he is of noble race, the son of a prophet. He
will tell thee truth, O Queen, as thy soul loveth.&rdquo;
Thus Elene let the other Jews go in peace, and took
Judas for a hostage.</p>


<h3>She Threatens him</h3>

<p>Now Elene greeted Judas and said:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Lo, thou perverse one, two things lie before thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or death or life for thee: choose which thou wilt.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="author">Elene.</p>

<p>Judas replied to her, since he could not escape:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;If the starved wanderer lost on the barren moors<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sees both a stone and bread, easily in his reach,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, O Queen, thinkest thou he will reject?&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="author">Elene.</p>

<p>Thereupon Elene said: &ldquo;If thou wouldst dwell in
heaven with the angels, reveal to me where the True
Cross lies hidden.&rdquo; Now Judas was very sad, for his
choice lay between death and the revealing of the fateful
secret, but he still tried to evade giving an answer,
protesting that too long a time had passed for the secret
to be known. Elene retorted that the Trojan War was
a still more ancient story, and yet was still well known;
but Judas replied that men are bound to remember the
valiant deeds of nations; he himself had never even
heard the story of which she spoke. This obstinacy
angered the queen greatly, and she demanded to be
taken at once to the hill of Calvary, that she might
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg&nbsp;59]</a></span>
purify it, for the sake of Him who died there; but
Judas only repeated:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;I know not the place, nor aught of that field.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="author">Elene.</p>

<p>Queen Elene was yet more enraged by his stubborn
denials, and determined to obtain by force an answer
to her questions. Calling her servants, she bade them
thrust Judas into a deep dry cistern, where he lay,
starving, bound hand and foot, for seven nights and
days. On the seventh day his stubborn spirit yielded,
and Judas lifted up his voice and called aloud, saying:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Now I beseech you all by the great God of heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That you will lift me up out of this misery.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will tell all I know of that True Holy Cross,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now I no longer can hide it for heavy pain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hunger has daunted me through all these dreary days.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Foolish was I of yore; late I confess it.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="author">Elene.</p>


<h3>He Guides her to Calvary</h3>

<p>The message was brought to Elene where she waited
to hear tidings, and she bade her servants lift the
weakened Judas from the dark pit; then they led
him, half dead with hunger, out of the city to the hill
of Calvary. There Judas prayed to the God whom he
now feared and worshipped for a sign, some token to
guide them in their search for the Holy Cross. As he
prayed a sweet-smelling vapour, curling upwards like
the incense-wreaths around the altar, rose to the skies
from the summit of the hill. The sign was manifest to
all, and Judas gave thanks to God for His great mercy;
then, bidding the wondering soldiers help him, he began
to dig. By this time all men knew what they sought,
and each wished to uncover the holy relic, so that all
dug with great zeal, until, under twenty feet of earth,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg&nbsp;60]</a></span>
they uncovered three crosses, so well preserved that
they lay in the earth just as the Jews had hidden them.</p>


<h3>Three Crosses Found</h3>

<p>Judas and all rejoiced greatly at this marvel, and,
reverently raising the three crosses, they bore them into
the city, and laid them at the feet of Queen Elene, whose
first rapture of joy was speedily turned to perplexity as
she realised that she knew not which was that sacred
Cross on which the King of Angels had suffered. &ldquo;For,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;two thieves were crucified with him.&rdquo; But
even Judas could not clear her doubts.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Lo we have heard of this from all the holy books,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That there were with him two in His deep anguish.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They hung in death by Him; He was Himself the third.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heaven was all darkened o&rsquo;er at that dread moment.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say, if thou rightly canst, which of these crosses<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is that blest Tree of Fate which bore the Heaven&rsquo;s King.&rdquo;<br /></span>

<p class="caption">The Queen&rsquo;s dilemma</p>


<h3>A Miracle to Reveal our Saviour&rsquo;s Cross</h3>

<p>Judas, however, suggested that the crosses should be
carried to the midst of the city, and that they should
pray for another miracle to reveal the truth. This was
done at dawn, and the triumphant band of Christians
raised hymns of prayer and praise until the ninth
hour; then came a mighty crowd bearing a young man
lifeless on his bier. At Judas&rsquo;s command they laid
down the bier, and he, praying to God, solemnly raised
in turn each of the crosses and held it above the dead
man&rsquo;s head. Lifeless still he lay as Judas raised the
first two, but when he held above the corpse the third,
the True Cross, the dead man arose instantly, body
and soul reunited, one in praising God, and the whole
multitude broke out into shouts of thanksgiving to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg&nbsp;61]</a></span>
Lord of Hosts, and the sacred relic was restored to the
loving care of the queen.</p>


<h3>The Nails Sought for</h3>

<p>Nevertheless Elene&rsquo;s longing was still unsatisfied.
She called Judas (whose new name in baptism was
Cyriacus) and begged him to fulfil her desires, and to
pray to God that she might find the nails which had
pierced the Lord of Life, where they lay hidden from
men in the ground of Calvary. Leading her out of the
town, Cyriacus again prayed on Mount Calvary that God
would send forth a token and reveal the secret. As
he prayed there came from heaven a leaping flame,
brighter than the sun, which touched the surface of the
ground here and there, and kindled in each place a tiny
star. When they dug at the spots where the stars
shone they found each nail shining visibly and casting
a radiance of its own in the dark earth. So Elene had
obtained her heart&rsquo;s desire, and had now the True
Cross and the Holy Nails.</p>


<h3>Good News Brought to Constantine</h3>

<p>Word of his mother&rsquo;s success was sent to the Emperor
Constantine, and he was asked what should be done
with these glorious relics. He bade Elene build in
Jerusalem a glorious church, and make therein a
beautiful shrine of silver, where the Holy Cross should
be guarded for all generations by priests who should
watch it day and night. This was done, but the nails
were still Elene&rsquo;s possession, and she was at a loss how
to preserve these holy relics, when the devout Cyriacus,
now ordained Bishop of Jerusalem, went to her and
said: &ldquo;O lady and queen, take these precious nails for
thy son the emperor. Make with them rings for his
horse&rsquo;s bridle. Victory shall ever go with them; they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg&nbsp;62]</a></span>
shall be called Holy to God, and he shall be called
blessed whom that horse bears.&rdquo; The advice pleased
the queen, and she had wrought a glorious bridle,
adorned with the Holy Nails, and sent it to her son.
Constantine received it with all reverence, and ordained
that April 24, the day of the miracle of revelation,
should henceforth be kept in honour as &ldquo;Holy Cross
Day.&rdquo; Thus were the Emperor&rsquo;s zeal and the royal
mother&rsquo;s devotion rewarded, and Christendom was
enriched by some of its most precious treasures, the
True Cross and the Holy Nails.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV: THE COMPASSION OF
CONSTANTINE</h2>


<h3>Youth of Constantine</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">C</span>ONSTANTINE THE GREAT was the eldest
son of the Roman Emperor Constantius and
the British Princess Helena, or Elena, and was
brought up as a devout worshipper of the many gods
of Rome. The lad grew up strong and handsome, of
a tall and majestic figure, skilled in all warlike exercises,
and, as he fought in the civil wars between the various
Roman emperors, he showed himself a bold and prudent
general in battle, a friendly and popular leader
in time of peace. The popularity of the youthful
Constantine was dangerous to him, and he needed, and
showed, great skill in evading the deadly jealousy of
the old Emperor Diocletian, and the hatred of his
father&rsquo;s rival, Galerius. At last, however, his position
became so dangerous that Constantius felt his son&rsquo;s
life was no longer safe, and earnestly begged him to
visit his native land of Britain, where Constantius had
just been proclaimed emperor and had defeated the
wild Caledonians. The excuse given was that Constantius
was in bad health and needed his son; but not
until the young man was actually in Britain would his
anxious father avow that he feared for his son&rsquo;s life.</p>


<h3>Acclaimed Emperor</h3>

<p>When the half-British Constantius died, Constantine,
who was the favourite of the Roman soldiery of the
west, was at once acclaimed as emperor by his devoted
troops. He professed unwillingness to accept the
honour, and it is said that he even tried in vain to escape
on horseback from the affectionate solicitations of his
soldiers. Seeing the uselessness of further protest,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg&nbsp;64]</a></span>
Constantine accepted the imperial title, and wrote to
Galerius claiming the throne and justifying his acceptance
of the unsought dignity thrust upon him. Galerius
acquiesced in the inevitable, and granted Constantine
the inferior title of &ldquo;C&aelig;sar,&rdquo; with rule over Western
Europe, and the wise prince was content to wait until
favouring circumstances should destroy his rivals and
give him that sole sway over the Roman Empire for
which he was so well fitted. He had now reached the
age of thirty, had fought valiantly in the wars in Egypt
and Persia, and had risen by merit to the rank of
tribune. His marriage with Fausta, the daughter of
the Emperor Maximian, and his elevation to the rank
of Augustus brought him nearer to the attainment of
his ambition; and at length the defeat and death of his
rivals placed him at the head of the world-wide empire
of Rome. It is to some period previous to Constantine&rsquo;s
elevation to the supreme authority that we
must refer the following story, told by Gower in his
&ldquo;Confessio Amantis&rdquo; as an example of that true charity
which is the mother of pity, and makes a man&rsquo;s heart so
tender that,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Though he might himself relieve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet he would not another grieve,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>but in order to give pleasure to others would bear his
own trouble alone.</p>


<h3>Becomes a Leper</h3>

<p>The noble Constantine, Emperor of Rome, was in
the full flower of his age, goodly to look upon, strong
and happy, when a great and sudden affliction came
upon him: leprosy attacked him. The horrible disease
showed itself first in his face, so that no concealment
was possible, and if he had not been the emperor
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg&nbsp;65]</a></span>
he would have been driven out to live in the forests
and wilds. The leprosy spread from his face till it
entirely covered his body, and became so bad that he
could no longer ride out or show himself to his people.
When all cures had been tried and had failed, Constantine
withdrew himself from his lords, gave up all
use of arms, abandoned his imperial duties, and shut
himself in his palace, where he lived such a secluded
life in his own apartments that Rome had, as it were,
no lord, and all men throughout the empire talked of
his illness and prayed their gods to heal him. When
everything seemed to be in vain, Constantine yielded
to the prayer of his council, that he would summon all
the doctors, learned men, and physicians from every
realm to Rome, that they might consider his illness
and try if any cure could be found for his malady.</p>


<h3>Rewards Offered for his Cure</h3>

<p>A proclamation went forth throughout the world
and great rewards were offered to any man who should
heal the emperor. Tempted by the rewards and the
great fame to be won, there came leeches and physicians
from Persia and Arabia, and from every land that owned
the sway of Rome, philosophers from Greece and Egypt,
and magicians and sorcerers from the unexplored desert
of the east. But, though Constantine tried all the
remedies suggested or recommended by the wise men,
his leprosy grew no better, but rather worse, and even
magic could give him no help.</p>

<p>Again the learned men assembled and consulted
what they should advise, for all were loath to abandon
the emperor in his great distress, but they were all
at a loss. They sat in silence, till at last one very old
and very wise man, a great physician from Arabia, arose
and said:</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg&nbsp;66]</a></span></p>

<h3>A Desperate Remedy</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Now that all else has failed, and naught is of any
avail, I will tell of a remedy of which I have heard. It
will, I believe, certainly cure our beloved emperor, but
it is very terrible, and therefore I was loath to name it
till every other means had been tried and failed, for it
is a cruel thing for any man to do. Let the Emperor
dip himself in a full bath of the blood of infants and
children, seven years old or under, and he shall be
healed, and his leprosy shall fall from him; for this
malady is not natural to his body, and it demands an
unnatural cure.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>Constantine Assents Regretfully</h3>

<p>The proposal was a terrible one to the assembly, and
many would not agree to it at first, but when they
considered that nothing else would heal the emperor
they at length gave way, and sent two from among
themselves to bring the news to Constantine, who was
waiting for them in his darkened room. He was
horrified when he heard the counsel they brought, and
at first utterly refused to carry out so evil a plan; but
because his life was very dear to his people, and because
he felt that he had a great work to do in the world, he
ultimately agreed, with many tears, to try the terrible
remedy.</p>


<h3>A Cruel Proclamation</h3>

<p>Thereupon the council drew up letters, under the
emperor&rsquo;s hand and seal, and sent them out to all the
world, bidding all mothers with children of seven years
of age or under to bring them with speed to Rome,
that there the blood of the innocents might prove healing
to the emperor&rsquo;s malady. Alas! what weeping and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg&nbsp;67]</a></span>
wailing there was among the mothers when they heard
this cruel decree! How they cried, and clasped their
babes to their breasts, and how they called Constantine
more cruel than Herod, who killed the Holy Innocents!
The eastern ruler, they said, slew only the infants of
one poor village, but their emperor, more ruthless,
claimed the lives of all the young children of his whole
empire.</p>


<h3>Constantine is Conscience-stricken</h3>

<p>But though the mothers lamented bitterly, they must
needs bow to the emperor&rsquo;s decree, whether they were
lief or loath, and thus a great multitude gathered in
the great courtyard of the imperial palace at Rome:
women nursing sucking-babes at the breast, or holding
toddling infants by the hand, or with little children
running by their sides, and all so heart-broken and
woebegone that many swooned for very grief. The
mothers wailed aloud, the children cried, and the tumult
grew until Constantine heard it, where he sat lonely
and wretched in his darkened room. He looked out
of his window on the mournful sight in the courtyard,
and was roused as from a trance, saying to himself:
&ldquo;O Divine Providence, who hast formed all men
alike, lo! the poor man is born, lives, suffers, and dies,
just as does the rich; to wise man and fool alike come
sickness and health; and no man may avoid that
fortune which Nature&rsquo;s law hath ordained for him.
Likewise to all men are Nature&rsquo;s gifts of strength and
beauty, of soul and reason, freely and fully given, so
that the poor child is born as capable of virtue as the
king&rsquo;s son; and to each man is given free will to
choose virtue or vice. Yet thou givest to men diversity
of rank, wealth or poverty, lordship or servitude, not
always according to their deserts; so much the more
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg&nbsp;68]</a></span>
virtuous should that man be to whom thou hast put
other men in subjection, men who are nevertheless his
fellows and wear his likeness. Thou, O God, who
hast put Nature and the whole universe under law,
wouldst have all men rule themselves by law, and
thou hast said that a man must do to others such
things as he would have done to himself.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>His Noble Resolve</h3>

<p>Thus Constantine spoke within himself as he stood
by the window and looked upon the weeping mothers
and children, the very sentinels of his palace pitying
them, and trying in vain to comfort them; and a strife
grew strong within him between his natural longing
for healing and deliverance from this loathsome disease
which had darkened his life, and the pity he felt for
these poor creatures, and his horror at the thought of
so much human blood to be shed for himself alone.
The great moaning of the woeful mothers came to him
and the pitiful crying of the children, and he thought:
&ldquo;What am I that my health is to outweigh the lives
and happiness of so many of my people? Is my life of
more value to the world than those of all the children
who must shed their blood for my healing? Surely
each babe is as precious as Constantine the Emperor!&rdquo;
Thus his heart grew so tender and so full of compassion
that he chose rather to die by this terrible sickness than
to commit so great a slaughter of innocent children, and
he renounced all other physicians, and trusted himself
wholly to God&rsquo;s care.</p>


<h3>He Announces his Determination</h3>

<p>He at once summoned his council, and announced
to them his resolution, giving as his reason, &ldquo;He that
will be truly master must be ever servant to pity!&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg&nbsp;69]</a></span>
and without delay the anxious mothers were told that
their children were free and safe, for the emperor had
renounced the cure, and needed their blood no longer.
What raptures of rejoicing there were, what outpouring
of blessing on the emperor, what songs of praise and
thanks from the women wild with joy, cannot be fully
told; and yet greater grew their joy and thankfulness
when Constantine, calling his high officials, bade them
take all his gathered treasures and distribute them
among the poor women, that they might feed and
clothe their children, and so return home untouched
by any loss, and recompensed in some degree for their
sufferings. Thus did Constantine obey the behests of
pity, and try to atone for the wrong to which he had
consented in his heart, and which he had so nearly done
to his people.</p>


<h3>The Victims Sent Home Happy</h3>

<p>Home to all parts of the Roman Empire went the
women, bearing with them their happy children, and
the rich gifts they had received. Each one thanked
and blessed the emperor, and sang his praises, where
before she had passed with tears and bitter curses on
his head; each woman shared her joy with her neighbours;
and the very children learnt from their mothers
and fathers to pray for the healing of their great lord,
who had given up his own will and sacrificed his own
cure for gentle pity&rsquo;s sake. Thus the whole world
prayed for Constantine&rsquo;s healing.</p>


<h3>A Vision</h3>

<p>Lo! it never yet was known that charity went unrequited
and this Constantine now learnt in his own
glad experience; for that same night, as he lay asleep,
God sent to him a vision of two strangers, men of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg&nbsp;70]</a></span>
noble face and form, whom he reverenced greatly, and
who said to him: &ldquo;O Constantine, because thou hast
obeyed the voice of pity, thou hast deserved pity;
therefore shalt thou find such mercy, that God, in His
great pity, will save thee. Double healing shalt thou
receive, first for thy body, and next for thy woeful soul;
both alike shall be made whole. And that thou mayst
not despair, God will grant thee a sign&mdash;thy leprosy
shall not increase till thou hast sent to Mount Celion,
to Sylvester and all his clergy. There they dwell in
secret for dread of thee, who hast been a foe to the law
of Christ, and hast destroyed those who preach in His
Holy Name. Now thou hast appeased God somewhat
by thy good deed, since thou hast had pity on the
innocent blood, and hast spared it; for this thou shalt
find teaching, from Sylvester, to the salvation of both
body and soul. Thou wilt need no other leech.&rdquo; The
emperor, who had listened with eagerness and awe,
now spoke: &ldquo;Great thanks I owe to you, my lords,
and I will indeed do as ye have said; but one thing I
would pray you&mdash;what shall I tell Sylvester of the
name or estate of those who send me to him?&rdquo; The
two strangers said: &ldquo;We are the Apostles Peter and
Paul, who endured death here in thy city of Rome for
the Holy Name of Christ, and we bid Sylvester teach
and baptize thee into the true faith. So shall the
Roman Empire become the kingdom of the Lord and
of His Christ.&rdquo; So saying, they blessed him, and passed
into the heavens out of his sight, and Constantine awoke
from his slumber and knew that he had seen a vision.
He called aloud eagerly, and his servants waiting in an
outer room ran in to him quickly, for there was urgency
in his voice. To them Constantine told his vision and
the command which was laid upon him.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg&nbsp;71]</a></span></p>

<h3>Sylvester Summoned</h3>

<p>Messengers rode in hot haste to Mount Celion, and
inquired long and anxiously for Sylvester. At last
they found him, a holy and venerable man, and summoned
him, saying: &ldquo;The Emperor calls for thee:
come, therefore, at once.&rdquo; Sylvester&rsquo;s clergy were
greatly affrighted, not knowing what this summons
might mean, and dreading the death of their dear
bishop and master; but he went forth gladly, not
knowing to what fate he was going. When he was
brought to the palace the emperor greeted him kindly,
and told him all his dream, and the command of the
Apostles Peter and Paul, and ended with these words:
&ldquo;Now I have done as the vision bade, and have fetched
thee here: tell me, I pray, the glad tidings which shall
bring healing to my body and soul.&rdquo; When Sylvester
heard this speech he was filled with joy and wonder,
and thanked God for the vision He had sent to the
emperor, and then he began to preach to him the
Christian faith: he told of the Fall of Man, and the
redemption of the world by the death and resurrection
of Jesus Christ, of the Ascension of Jesus and His
return at the Day of Judgment, of the justice of God,
who will judge all men impartially according to their
works, good or bad, and of the life of joy or misery to
come. As Sylvester taught, the monarch listened and
believed, and, when the tale was ended, announced his
conversion to the true faith, and said he was ready,
with his whole heart and soul, to be baptized.</p>


<h3>Constantine Baptized</h3>

<p>At the emperor&rsquo;s command, they took the great
vessel of silver which had been made for the children&rsquo;s
blood, and Sylvester bade them fill it with pure water
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg&nbsp;72]</a></span>
from the well. When that was done with all haste,
he bade Constantine stand therein, so that the water
reached his chin. As the holy rite began a great
light like the sun&rsquo;s rays shone from heaven into the
place, and upon Constantine; and as the sacred words
were being read there fell now and again from his
body scales like those of a fish, till there was nothing
left of his horrible disease; and thus in baptism
Constantine was purified in body and soul.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V: HAVELOK THE DANE</h2>


<h3>The Origin of the Story</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE Danish occupation of England has left a
very strong mark on our country in various
ways&mdash;on its place-names, its racial characteristics,
its language, its literature, and, in part, on
its ideals. The legend of Havelok the Dane, with
its popularity and widespread influence, is one result
of Danish supremacy. It is thought that the origin of
the legend, which contains a twofold version of the
common story of the cruel guardian and the persecuted
heir, is to be found in Wales; but, however that may
be, it is certain that in the continual rise and fall of small
tribal kingdoms, Celtic or Teutonic, English or Danish,
the circumstances out of which the story grew must
have been common enough. Kings who died leaving
helpless heirs to the guardianship of ambitious and
wicked nobles were not rare in the early days of
Britain, Wales, or Denmark; the murder of the heir
and the usurpation of the kingdom by the cruel regent
were no unusual occurrences. The opportunity of
localising the early legend seems to have come with
the growing fame of Anlaf, or Olaf, Sihtricson, who
was known to the Welsh as Abloec or Habloc. His
adventurous life included a threefold expulsion from
his inheritance of Northumbria, a marriage with the
daughter of King Constantine III. of Scotland, and a
family kinship with King Athelstan of England. In
Anlaf Curan (as he was called) we have an historical
hero on whom various romantic stories were gradually
fathered, because of his adventurous life and his strong
personality. These stories finally crystallized in a
form which shows the English and Danish love of
physical prowess (Havelok is the strongest man in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg&nbsp;74]</a></span>
kingdom), as well as a certain cruelty of revenge
which is more peculiarly Danish. There is resentment
of the Norman predominance to be found in the
popularity of a story which shows the kitchen-boy
excelling all the nobles in manly exercises, and the
heiress to the kingdom wedded in scorn, as so many
Saxon heiresses were after the Conquest, to a mere
scullion. There can be no doubt, however, that
Havelok stood to medi&aelig;val England as a hero of the
strong arm, a champion of the populace against the
ruling race, and that his royal birth and dignity were a
concession to historic facts and probabilities, not much
regarded by the common people. The story, again,
showed another truly humble hero, Grim the fisher,
whose loyalty was supposed to account for the special
trading privileges of his town, Grimsby. In Grim the
story found a character who was in reality a hero of
the poor and lowly, with the characteristic devotion of
the tribesman to his chief, of the vassal to his lord, a
devotion which was handed on from father to son, so
that a second generation continued the services, and
received the rewards, of the father who risked life and
all for the sake of his king&rsquo;s heir.</p>

<p>The reader will not fail to notice the characteristic
anachronisms which give to life in Saxon England in
the tenth century the colour of the Norman chivalry of
the thirteenth.</p>


<h3>Havelok and Godard</h3>

<p>In Denmark, long ago, lived a good king named
Birkabeyn, rich and powerful, a great warrior and a
man of mighty prowess, whose rule was undisputed
over the whole realm. He had three children&mdash;two
daughters, named Swanborow and Elfleda the Fair, and
one young and goodly son, Havelok, the heir to all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg&nbsp;75]</a></span>
his dominions. All too soon came the day that no
man can avoid, when Death would call King Birkabeyn
away, and he grieved sore over his young children to
be left fatherless and unprotected; but, after much
reflection, and prayers to God for wisdom to help
his choice, he called to him Jarl Godard, a trusted
counsellor and friend, and committed into his hands
the care of the realm and of the three royal children,
until Havelok should be of age to be knighted and
rule the land himself. King Birkabeyn felt that such a
charge was too great a temptation for any man unbound
by oaths of fealty and honour, and although he did not
distrust his friend, he required Godard to swear,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;By altar and by holy service book,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By bells that call the faithful to the church,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By blessed sacrament, and sacred rites,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Holy Rood, and Him who died thereon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thou wilt truly rule and keep my realm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wilt guard my babes in love and loyalty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until my son be grown, and dubb&egrave;d knight:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thou wilt then resign to him his land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His power and rule, and all that owns his sway.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Jarl Godard took this most solemn oath at once
with many protestations of affection and whole-hearted
devotion to the dying king and his heir, and King
Birkabeyn died happy in the thought that his children
would be well cared for during their helpless youth.</p>

<p>When the funeral rites were celebrated Jarl Godard
assumed the rule of the country, and, under pretext of
securing the safety of the royal children, removed them
to a strong castle, where no man was allowed access to
them, and where they were kept so closely that the
royal residence became a prison in all but name.
Godard, finding Denmark submit to his government
without resistance, began to adopt measures to rid
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg&nbsp;76]</a></span>
himself of the real heirs to the throne, and gave orders
that food and clothes should be supplied to the three
children in such scanty quantities that they might die of
hardship; but since they were slow to succumb to this
cruel, torturing form of murder, he resolved to slay
them suddenly, knowing that no one durst call him to
account. Having steeled his heart against all pitiful
thoughts, he went to the castle, and was taken to the
inner dungeon where the poor babes lay shivering and
weeping for cold and hunger. As he entered, Havelok,
who was even then a bold lad, greeted him courteously,
and knelt before him, with clasped hands, begging a
boon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you weep and wail so sore?&rdquo; asked
Godard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because we are so hungry,&rdquo; answered Havelok.
&ldquo;We have so little food, and we have no servants to
wait on us; they do not give us half as much as we
could eat; we are shivering with cold, and our clothes
are all in rags. Woe to us that we were ever born! Is
there in the land no more corn with which men can
make bread for us? We are nearly dead from hunger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These pathetic words had no effect on Godard, who
had resolved to yield to no pity and show no mercy.
He seized the two little girls as they lay cowering
together, clasping one another for warmth, and cut their
throats, letting the bodies of the hapless babies fall to
the floor in a pool of blood; and then, turning to
Havelok, aimed his knife at the boy&rsquo;s heart. The poor
child, terrified by the awful fate of the two girls, knelt
again before him and begged for mercy:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Fair lord, have mercy on me now, I pray!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look on my helpless youth, and pity me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, let me live, and I will yield you all&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My realm of Denmark will I leave to you,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg&nbsp;77]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And swear that I will ne&rsquo;er assail your sway.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, pity me, lord! be compassionate!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I will flee far from this land of mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And vow that Birkabeyn was ne&rsquo;er my sire!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Jarl Godard was touched by Havelok&rsquo;s piteous speech,
and felt some faint compassion, so that he could not
slay the lad himself; yet he knew that his only safety
was in Havelok&rsquo;s death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I let him go,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;Havelok will at last
work me woe! I shall have no peace in my life, and
my children after me will not hold the lordship of Denmark
in safety, if Havelok escapes! Yet I cannot slay
him with my own hands. I will have him cast into the
sea with an anchor about his neck: thus at least his
body will not float.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Godard left Havelok kneeling in terror, and, striding
from the tower, leaving the door locked behind him, he
sent for an ignorant fisherman, Grim, who, he thought,
could be frightened into doing his will. When Grim
came he was led into an ante-room, where Godard, with
terrible look and voice, addressed him thus:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grim, thou knowest thou art my thrall.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yea,
fair lord,&rdquo; quoth Grim, trembling at Godard&rsquo;s stern
voice. &ldquo;And I can slay thee if thou dost disobey me.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yea, lord; but how have I offended you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Thou
hast not yet; but I have a task for thee, and if thou
dost it not, dire punishment shall fall upon thee.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Lord, what is the work that I must do?&rdquo; asked the
poor fisherman. &ldquo;Tarry: I will show thee.&rdquo; Then
Godard went into the inner room of the tower, whence
he returned leading a fair boy, who wept bitterly.
&ldquo;Take this boy secretly to thy house, and keep him
there till dead of night; then launch thy boat, row out
to sea, and fling him therein with an anchor round his
neck, so that I shall see him never again.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg&nbsp;78]</a></span>
Grim looked curiously at the weeping boy, and said:
&ldquo;What reward shall I have if I work this sin for
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Godard replied: &ldquo;The sin will be on my head as I
am thy lord and bid thee do it; but I will make thee a
freeman, noble and rich, and my friend, if thou wilt do
this secretly and discreetly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus reassured and bribed, Grim suddenly took the
boy, flung him to the ground, and bound him hand
and foot with cord which he took from his pockets.
So anxious was he to secure the boy that he drew the
cords very tight, and Havelok suffered terrible pain;
he could not cry out, for a handful of rags was thrust
into his mouth and over his nostrils, so that he could
hardly breathe. Then Grim flung the poor boy into a
horrible black sack, and carried him thus from the
castle, as if he were bringing home broken food for his
family. When Grim reached his poor cottage, where
his wife Leve was waiting for him, he slung the
sack from his shoulder and gave it to her, saying,
&ldquo;Take good care of this boy as of thy life. I am to
drown him at midnight, and if I do so my lord has
promised to make me a free man and give me great
wealth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Dame Leve heard this she sprang up and
flung the lad down in a corner, and nearly broke his
head with the crash against the earthen floor. There
Havelok lay, bruised and aching, while the couple
went to sleep, leaving the room all dark but for the
red glow from the fire. At midnight Grim awoke to
do his lord&rsquo;s behest, and Dame Leve, going to the
living-room to kindle a light, was terrified by a
mysterious gleam as bright as day which shone around
the boy on the floor and streamed from his mouth.
Leve hastily called Grim to see this wonder, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg&nbsp;79]</a></span>
together they released Havelok from the gag and
bonds and examined his body, when they found on the
right shoulder the token of true royalty, a cross of red
gold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God knows,&rdquo; quoth Grim, &ldquo;that this is the heir of
our land. He will come to rule in good time, will bear
sway over England and Denmark, and will punish the
cruel Godard.&rdquo; Then, weeping sore, the loyal fisherman
fell down at Havelok&rsquo;s feet, crying, &ldquo;Lord, have
mercy on me and my wife! We are thy thralls, and
never will we do aught against thee. We will nourish
thee until thou canst rule, and will hide thee from
Godard; and thou wilt perchance give me my freedom
in return for thy life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this unexpected address Havelok sat up surprised,
and rubbed his bruised head and said: &ldquo;I am nearly
dead, what with hunger, and thy cruel bonds, and the
gag. Now bring me food in plenty!&rdquo; &ldquo;Yea, lord,&rdquo;
said Dame Leve, and bustled about, bringing the best
they had in the hut; and Havelok ate as if he had
fasted for three days; and then he was put to bed, and
slept in peace while Grim watched over him.</p>

<a name="image_page_78" id="image_page_78"></a>
</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;Havelok sat up surprised&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, Grim went the next morning to Jarl Godard
and said: &ldquo;Lord, I have done your behest, and drowned
the boy with an anchor about his neck. He is safe,
and now, I pray you, give me my reward, the gold and
other treasures, and make me a freeman as you have
promised.&rdquo; But Godard only looked fiercely at him
and said: &ldquo;What, wouldst thou be an earl? Go home,
thou foul churl, and be ever a thrall! It is enough
reward that I do not hang thee now for insolence, and
for thy wicked deeds. Go speedily, else thou mayst
stand and palter with me too long.&rdquo; And Grim shrank
quietly away, lest Godard should slay him for the
murder of Havelok.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg&nbsp;80]</a></span>
Now Grim saw in what a terrible plight he stood, at
the mercy of this cruel and treacherous man, and he
took counsel with himself and consulted his wife, and
the two decided to flee from Denmark to save their
lives. Gradually Grim sold all his stock, his cattle, his
nets, everything that he owned, and turned it into good
pieces of gold; then he bought and secretly fitted out
and provisioned a ship, and at last, when all was ready,
carried on board Havelok (who had lain hidden all this
time), his own three sons and two daughters; then
when he and his wife had gone on board he set sail,
and, driven by a favourable wind, reached the shores of
England.</p>


<h3>Goldborough and Earl Godrich</h3>

<p>Meanwhile in England a somewhat similar fate had
befallen a fair princess named Goldborough. When
her father, King Athelwold, lay dying all his people
mourned, for he was the flower of all fair England for
knighthood, justice, and mercy; and he himself grieved
sorely for the sake of his little daughter, soon to be left
an orphan. &ldquo;What will she do?&rdquo; moaned he. &ldquo;She
can neither speak nor walk! If she were only able to
ride, to rule England, and to guard herself from shame,
I should have no grief, even if I died and left her
alone, while I lived in the joy of paradise!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Athelwold summoned a council to be held at
Winchester, and asked the advice of the nobles as to
the care of the infant Goldborough. They with one
accord recommended Earl Godrich of Cornwall to be
made regent for the little princess; and the earl, on
being appointed, swore with all solemn rites that he
would marry her at twelve years old to the highest,
the best, fairest, and strongest man alive, and in the
meantime would train her in all royal virtues and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg&nbsp;81]</a></span>
customs. So King Athelwold died, and was buried
with great lamentations, and Godrich ruled the land as
regent. He was a strict but just governor, and England
had great peace, without and within, under his severe
rule, for all lived in awe of him, though no man loved
him. Goldborough grew and throve in all ways, and
became famous through the land for her gracious
beauty and gentle and virtuous demeanour. This
roused the jealousy of Earl Godrich, who had played
the part of king so long that he almost believed himself
King of England, and he began to consider how
he could secure the kingdom for himself and his son.
Thereupon he had Goldborough taken from Winchester,
where she kept royal state, to Dover, where she was
imprisoned in the castle, and strictly secluded from all
her friends; there she remained, with poor clothes and
scanty food, awaiting a champion to uphold her right.</p>


<h3>Havelok Becomes Cook&rsquo;s Boy</h3>

<p>When Grim sailed from Denmark to England he
landed in the Humber, at the place now called Grimsby,
and there established himself as a fisherman. So successful
was he that for twelve years he supported his
family well, and carried his catches of fish far afield,
even to Lincoln, where rare fish always brought a good
price. In all this time Grim never once called on
Havelok for help in the task of feeding the family; he
reverenced his king, and the whole household served
Havelok with the utmost deference, and often went
with scanty rations to satisfy the boy&rsquo;s great appetite.
At length Havelok began to think how selfishly he
was living, and how much food he consumed, and was
filled with shame when he realized how his foster-father
toiled unweariedly while he did nothing to help. In
his remorseful meditations it became clear to him that,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg&nbsp;82]</a></span>
though a king&rsquo;s son, he ought to do some useful work.
&ldquo;Of what use,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;is my great strength and
stature if I do not employ it for some good purpose?
There is no shame in honest toil. I will work for my
food, and try to make some return to Father Grim,
who has done so much for me. I will gladly bear his
baskets of fish to market, and I will begin to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the next day, in spite of Grim&rsquo;s protests
Havelok carried a load of fish equal to four men&rsquo;s
burden to Grimsby market, and sold it successfully,
returning home with the money he received; and this
he did day by day, till a famine arose and fish and
food both became scarce. Then Grim, more concerned
for Havelok than for his own children, called the youth
to him and bade him try his fortunes in Lincoln, for
his own sake and for theirs; he would be better fed,
and the little food Grim could get would go further
among the others if Havelok were not there. The one
obstacle in the way was Havelok&rsquo;s lack of clothes, and
Grim overcame that by sacrificing his boat&rsquo;s sail to
make Havelok a coarse tunic. That done, they bade
each other farewell, and Havelok started for Lincoln,
barefooted and bareheaded, for his only garment was
the sailcloth tunic. In Lincoln Havelok found no
friends and no food for two days, and he was desperate
and faint with hunger, when he heard a call: &ldquo;Porters,
porters! hither to me!&rdquo; Roused to new vigour by
the chance of work, Havelok rushed with the rest,
and bore down and hurled aside the other porters so
vigorously that he was chosen to carry provisions for
Bertram, the earl&rsquo;s cook; and in return he received
the first meal he had eaten for nearly three days.</p>

<p>On the next day Havelok again overthrew the
porters, and, knocking down at least sixteen, secured the
work. This time he had to carry fish, and his basket
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg&nbsp;83]</a></span>
was so laden that he bore nearly a cartload, with
which he ran to the castle. There the cook, amazed at
his strength, first gave him a hearty meal, and then
offered him good service under himself, with food and
lodging for his wages. This offer Havelok accepted,
and was installed as cook&rsquo;s boy, and employed in all the
lowest offices&mdash;carrying wood, water, turf, hewing logs,
lifting, fetching, carrying&mdash;and in all he showed himself
a wonderfully strong worker, with unfailing good
temper and gentleness, so that the little children all
loved the big, gentle, fair-haired youth who worked
so quietly and played with them so merrily. When
Havelok&rsquo;s old tunic became worn out, his master, the
cook, took pity on him and gave him a new suit, and
then it could be seen how handsome and tall and strong
a youth this cook&rsquo;s boy really was, and his fame spread
far and wide round Lincoln Town.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 409px;">
<img src="images/hmlbr12.jpg" width="409" height="600" alt="" />
<a name="image_page_82" id="image_page_82"></a>
</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;Havelok again overthrew the porters&rdquo;</p>


<h3>Havelok and Goldborough</h3>

<p>At the great fair of Lincoln, sports of all kinds were
indulged in, and in these Havelok took his part, for
the cook, proud of his mighty scullion, urged him to
compete in all the games and races. As Earl Godrich
had summoned his Parliament to meet that year at
Lincoln, there was a great concourse of spectators,
and even the powerful Earl Regent himself sometimes
watched the sports and cheered the champions. The
first contest was &ldquo;putting the stone,&rdquo; and the stone
chosen was so weighty that none but the most stalwart
could lift it above the knee&mdash;none could raise it to his
breast. This sport was new to Havelok, who had
never seen it before, but when the cook bade him try
his strength he lifted the stone easily and threw it
more than twelve feet. This mighty deed caused his
fame to be spread, not only among the poor servants
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg&nbsp;84]</a></span>
with whom Havelok was classed, but also among the
barons, their masters, and Havelok&rsquo;s Stone became a
landmark in Lincoln. Thus Godrich heard of a youth
who stood head and shoulders taller than other men
and was stronger, more handsome&mdash;and yet a mere
common scullion. The news brought him a flash of
inspiration: &ldquo;Here is the highest, strongest, best man
in all England, and him shall Goldborough wed. I
shall keep my vow to the letter, and England must fall
to me, for Goldborough&rsquo;s royal blood will be lost by
her marriage with a thrall, the people will refuse her
obedience, and England will cast her out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Godrich therefore brought Goldborough to Lincoln,
received her with bell-ringing and seemly rejoicing,
and bade her prepare for her wedding. This the
princess refused to do until she knew who was her
destined husband, for she said she would wed no man
who was not of royal birth. Her firmness drove Earl
Godrich to fierce wrath, and he burst out: &ldquo;Wilt thou
be queen and mistress over me? Thy pride shall be
brought down: thou shalt have no royal spouse: a
vagabond and scullion shalt thou wed, and that no
later than to-morrow! Curses on him who speaks thee
fair!&rdquo; In vain the princess wept and bemoaned herself:
the wedding was fixed for the morrow morn.</p>

<p>The next day at dawn Earl Godrich sent for Havelok,
the mighty cook&rsquo;s boy, and asked him: &ldquo;Wilt
thou take a wife?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; quoth Havelok, &ldquo;that will I not. I cannot
feed her, much less clothe and lodge her. My very
garments are not my own, but belong to the cook, my
master.&rdquo; Godrich fell upon Havelok and beat him
furiously, saying, &ldquo;Unless thou wilt take the wench I
give thee for wife I will hang or blind thee&rdquo;; and so,
in great fear, Havelok agreed to the wedding. At
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg&nbsp;85]</a></span>
once Goldborough was brought, and forced into an
immediate marriage, under penalty of banishment or
burning as a witch if she refused. And thus the unwilling
couple were united by the Archbishop of York,
who had come to attend the Parliament.</p>

<p>Never was there so sad a wedding! The people
murmured greatly at this unequal union, and pitied the
poor princess, thus driven to wed a man of low birth;
and Goldborough herself wept pitifully, but resigned
herself to God&rsquo;s will. All men now acknowledged with
grief that she and her husband could have no claim to
the English throne, and thus Godrich seemed to have
gained his object. Havelok and his unwilling bride
recognised that they would not be safe near Godrich,
and as Havelok had no home in Lincoln to which he
could take the princess, he determined to go back to his
faithful foster-father, Grim, and put the fair young bride
under his loyal protection. Sorrowfully, with grief and
shame in their hearts, Havelok and Goldborough made
their way on foot to Grimsby, only to find the loyal
Grim dead; but his five children were alive and in
prosperity. When they saw Havelok and his wife they
fell on their knees and saluted them with all respect
and reverence. In their joy to see their king again,
these worthy fisherfolk forgot their newly won wealth,
and said: &ldquo;Welcome, dear lord, and thy fair lady!
What joy is ours to see thee again, for thy subjects are
we, and thou canst do with us as thou wilt. All that
we have is thine, and if thou wilt dwell with us we will
serve thee and thy wife truly in all ways!&rdquo; This
greeting surprised Goldborough, who began to suspect
some mystery, and she was greatly comforted when
brothers and sisters busied themselves in lighting fires,
cooking meals, and waiting on her hand and foot, as if
she had been indeed a king&rsquo;s wife. Havelok, however,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg&nbsp;86]</a></span>
said nothing to explain the mystery, and Goldborough
that night lay awake bewailing her fate as a thrall&rsquo;s
bride, even though he was the fairest man in England.</p>


<h3>The Revelation and Return to Denmark</h3>

<p>As Goldborough lay sleepless and unhappy she became
aware of a brilliant light shining around Havelok
and streaming from his mouth; and while she feared
and wondered an angelic voice cried to her:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Fair Princess, cease this grief and heavy moan!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Havelok, thy newly wedded spouse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is son and heir to famous kings: the sign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou findest in the cross of ruddy gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That shineth on his shoulder. He shall be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Monarch and ruler of two mighty realms;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Denmark and England shall obey his rule,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he shall sway them with a sure command.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This shalt thou see with thine own eyes, and be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lady and Queen, with Havelok, o&rsquo;er these lands.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>This angelic message so gladdened Goldborough that
she kissed, for the first time, her unconscious husband,
who started up from his sleep, saying, &ldquo;Dear love,
sleepest thou? I have had a wondrous dream. I
thought I sat on a lofty hill, and saw all Denmark
before me. As I stretched out my arms I embraced it
all, and the people clung to my arms, and the castles
fell at my feet; then I flew over the salt sea with the
Danish people clinging to me, and I closed all fair
England in my hand, and gave it to thee, dear love!
Now what can this mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Goldborough answered joyfully: &ldquo;It means, dear
heart, that thou shalt be King of Denmark and of England
too: all these realms shall fall into thy power, and
thou shalt be ruler in Denmark within one year. Now
do thou follow my advice, and let us go to Denmark,
taking with us Grim&rsquo;s three sons, who will accompany
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg&nbsp;87]</a></span>
thee for love and loyalty; and have no fear, for I know
thou wilt succeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next morning Havelok went to church early, and
prayed humbly and heartily for success in his enterprise
and retribution on the false traitor Godard; then, laying
his offering on the altar before the Cross, he went away
glad in heart. Grim&rsquo;s three sons, Robert the Red,
William Wendut, and Hugh the Raven, joyfully consented
to go with Havelok to Denmark, to attack with
all their power the false Jarl Godard and to win the
kingdom for the rightful heir. Their wives and families
stayed in England, but Goldborough would not leave
her husband, and after a short voyage the party landed
safely on the shores of Denmark, in the lands of Jarl
Ubbe, an old friend of King Birkabeyn, who lived far
from the court now that a usurper held sway in Denmark.</p>


<h3>Havelok and Ubbe</h3>

<p>Havelok dared not reveal himself and his errand
until he knew more of the state of parties in the
country, and he therefore only begged permission to
live and trade there, giving Ubbe, as a token of goodwill
and a tribute to his power, a valuable ring, which
the jarl prized greatly. Ubbe, gazing at the so-called
merchant&rsquo;s great stature and beauty, lamented that he
was not of noble birth, and planned to persuade him
to take up the profession of arms. At first, however,
he simply granted Havelok permission to trade, and
invited him and Goldborough to a feast, promising
them safety and honour under his protection. Havelok
dreaded lest his wife&rsquo;s beauty might place them in
jeopardy, but he dared not refuse the invitation, which
was pointedly given to both; accordingly, when they
went to Ubbe&rsquo;s hall, Goldborough was escorted by
Robert the Red and William Wendut.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg&nbsp;88]</a></span>
Ubbe received them with all honour, and all men
marvelled at Goldborough&rsquo;s beauty, and Ubbe&rsquo;s wife
loved Goldborough at first sight as her husband did
Havelok, so that the feast passed off with all joy and
mirth, and none dared raise a hand or lift his voice
against the wandering merchant whom Ubbe so strangely
favoured. But Ubbe knew that when once Havelok
and his wife were away from his protection there would
be little safety for them, since the rough Danish nobles
would think nothing of stealing a trader&rsquo;s fair wife, and
many a man had cast longing eyes on Goldborough&rsquo;s
loveliness. Therefore when the feast was over, and
Havelok took his leave, Ubbe sent with him a body of
ten knights and sixty men-at-arms, and recommended
them to the magistrate of the town, Bernard Brown,
a true and upright man, bidding him, as he prized
his life, keep the strangers in safety and honour. Well
it was that Ubbe and Bernard Brown took these precautions,
for late at night a riotous crowd came to
Bernard&rsquo;s house clamouring for admittance. Bernard
withstood the angry mob, armed with a great axe, but
they burst the door in by hurling a huge stone; and
then Havelok joined in the defence. He drew out the
great beam which barred the door, and crying, &ldquo;Come
quickly to me, and you shall stay here! Curses on him
who flees!&rdquo; began to lay about him with the big beam, so
that three fell dead at once. A terrible fight followed, in
which Havelok, armed only with the beam, slew twenty
men in armour, and was then sore beset by the rest of the
troop, aiming darts and arrows at his unarmoured breast.
It was going hardly with him, when Hugh the Raven,
hearing and understanding the cries of the assailants,
called his brothers to their lord&rsquo;s aid, and they all joined
the fight so furiously that, long ere day, of the sixty men
who had attacked the inn not one remained alive.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg&nbsp;89]</a></span>
In the morning news was brought to Jarl Ubbe that
his stranger guest had slain sixty of the best of his
soldiery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can this mean?&rdquo; said Ubbe. &ldquo;I had better
go and see to it myself, for any messenger would
surely treat Havelok discourteously, and I should be
full loath to do that.&rdquo; He rode away to the house of
Bernard Brown, and asked the meaning of its damaged
and battered appearance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; answered Bernard Brown, &ldquo;last night
at moonrise there came a band of sixty thieves who
would have plundered my house and bound me hand
and foot. When Havelok and his companions saw it
they came to my aid, with sticks and stones, and drove
out the robbers like dogs from a mill. Havelok himself
slew three at one blow. Never have I seen a warrior
so good! He is worth a thousand in a fray. But
alas! he is grievously wounded, with three deadly
gashes in side and arm and thigh, and at least twenty
smaller wounds. I am scarcely harmed at all, but I
fear he will die full soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ubbe could scarcely believe so strange a tale, but all
the bystanders swore that Bernard told nothing but the
bare truth, and that the whole gang of thieves, with
their leader, Griffin the Welshman, had been slain by
the hero and his small party. Then Ubbe bade them
bring Havelok, that he might call a leech to heal his
wounds, for if the stranger merchant should live Jarl
Ubbe would without fail dub him knight; and when the
leech had seen the wounds he said the patient would
make a good and quick recovery. Then Ubbe offered
Havelok and his wife a dwelling in his own castle,
under his own protection, till Havelok&rsquo;s grievous
wounds were healed. There, too, fair Goldborough
would be under the care of Ubbe&rsquo;s wife, who would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg&nbsp;90]</a></span>
cherish her as her own daughter. This kind offer was
accepted gladly, and they all went to the castle, where a
room was given them next to Ubbe&rsquo;s own.</p>

<p>At midnight Ubbe woke, aroused by a bright light
in Havelok&rsquo;s room, which was only separated from his
own by a slight wooden partition. He was vexed
suspecting his guest of midnight wassailing, and went
to inquire what villainy might be hatching. To his
surprise, both husband and wife were sound asleep, but
the light shone from Havelok&rsquo;s mouth, and made a
glory round his head. Utterly amazed at the marvel,
Ubbe went away silently, and returned with all the
garrison of his castle to the room where his guests
still lay sleeping. As they gazed on the light Havelok
turned in his sleep, and they saw on his shoulder the
golden cross, shining like the sun, which all men knew
to be the token of royal birth. Then Ubbe exclaimed:
&ldquo;Now I know who this is, and why I loved him so
dearly at first sight: this is the son of our dead King
Birkabeyn. Never was man so like another as this man
is to the dead king: he is his very image and his true
heir.&rdquo; With great joy they fell on their knees and
kissed him eagerly, and Havelok awoke and began to
scowl furiously, for he thought it was some treacherous
attack; but Ubbe soon undeceived him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 412px;">
<img src="images/hmlbr13.jpg" width="412" height="600" alt="" />
<a name="image_page_88" id="image_page_88"></a>
</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;With great joy they fell on their knees&rdquo;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Dear lord,&rsquo; quoth he, &lsquo;be thou in naught dismayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in thine eyes methinks I see thy thought&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dear son, great joy is mine to live this day!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My homage, lord, I freely offer thee:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy loyal men and vassals are we all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For thou art son of mighty Birkabeyn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soon shalt conquer all thy father&rsquo;s land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though thou art young and almost friendless here.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To-morrow will we swear our fealty due,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dub thee knight, for prowess unexcelled.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now Havelok knew that his worst danger was over,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg&nbsp;91]</a></span>
and he thanked God for the friend He had sent him,
and left to the good Jarl Ubbe the management of his
cause. Ubbe gathered an assembly of as many mighty
men of the realm, and barons, and good citizens, as he
could summon; and when they were all assembled,
pondering what was the cause of this imperative
summons, Ubbe arose and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentles, bear with me if I tell you first things well
known to you. Ye know that King Birkabeyn ruled
this land until his death-day, and that he left three
children&mdash;one son, Havelok, and two daughters&mdash;to the
guardianship of Jarl Godard: ye all heard him swear
to keep them loyally and treat them well. But ye do
not know how he kept his oath! The false traitor
slew both the maidens, and would have slain the boy,
but for pity he would not kill the child with his own
hands. He bade a fisherman drown him in the sea;
but when the good man knew that it was the rightful
heir, he saved the boy&rsquo;s life and fled with him to
England, where Havelok has been brought up for
many years. And now, behold! here he stands. In
all the world he has no peer, and ye may well rejoice
in the beauty and manliness of your king. Come now
and pay homage to Havelok, and I myself will be your
leader!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jarl Ubbe turned to Havelok, where he stood with
Goldborough beside him, and knelt before him to do
homage, an example which was followed by all present.
At a second and still larger assembly held a fortnight
later a similar oath of fealty was sworn by all, Havelok
was dubbed knight by the noble Ubbe, and a great
festival was celebrated, with sports and amusements for
the populace. A council of war and vengeance was
held with the great nobles.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg&nbsp;92]</a></span></p>

<h3>The Death of Godard</h3>

<p>Havelok, now acknowledged King of Denmark,
was unsatisfied until he had punished the treacherous
Godard, and he took a solemn oath from his soldiers
that they would never cease the search for the traitor
till they had captured him and brought him bound to
judgment. After all, Godard was captured as he was
hunting. Grim&rsquo;s three sons, now knighted by King
Havelok, met him in the forest, and bade him come
to the king, who called on him to remember and
account for his treatment of Birkabeyn&rsquo;s children.
Godard struck out furiously with his fists, but Sir
Robert the Red wounded him in the right arm. When
Godard&rsquo;s men joined in the combat, Robert and his
brothers soon slew ten of their adversaries, and the
rest fled; returning, ashamed at the bitter reproaches
of their lord, they were all slain by Havelok&rsquo;s men.
Godard was taken, bound hand and foot, placed on a
miserable jade with his face to the tail, and so led to
Havelok. The king refused to be the judge of his
own cause, and entrusted to Ubbe the task of presiding
at the traitor&rsquo;s trial. No mercy was shown to the cruel
Jarl Godard, and he was condemned to a traitor&rsquo;s
death, with torments of terrible barbarity. The sentence
was carried out to the letter, and Denmark rejoiced in
the punishment of a cruel villain.</p>


<h3>Death of Godrich</h3>

<p>Meanwhile Earl Godrich of Cornwall had heard
with great uneasiness that Havelok had become King
of Denmark, and intended to invade England with a
mighty army to assert his wife&rsquo;s right to the throne.
He recognised that his own device to shame Goldborough
had turned against him, and that he must
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg&nbsp;93]</a></span>
now fight for his life and the usurped dominion he held
over England. Godrich summoned his army to Lincoln
for the defence of the realm against the Danes, and
called out every man fit to bear weapons, on pain of
becoming thrall if they failed him. Then he thus
addressed them:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Friends, listen to my words, and you will know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&rsquo;Tis not for sport, nor idle show, that I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have bidden you to meet at Lincoln here.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo! here at Grimsby foreigners are come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who have already won the Priory.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These Danes are cruel heathen, who destroy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our churches and our abbeys: priests and nuns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They torture to the death, or lead away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To serve as slaves the haughty Danish jarls.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, Englishmen, what counsel will ye take?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If we submit, they will rule all our land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will kill us all, and sell our babes for thralls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will take our wives and daughters for their own.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Help me, if ever ye loved English land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fight these heathen and to cleanse our soil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From hateful presence of these alien hordes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I make my vow to God and all the saints<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will not rest, nor houseled be, nor shriven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until our realm be free from Danish foe!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Accursed be he who strikes no blow for home!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The army was inspired with valour by these courageous
words, and the march to Grimsby began at
once, with Earl Godrich in command. Havelok&rsquo;s men
marched out gallantly to meet them, and when the
battle joined many mighty deeds of valour were done,
especially by the king himself, his foster-brothers, and
Jarl Ubbe. The battle lasted long and was very fierce
and bloody, but the Danes gradually overcame the
resistance of the English, and at last, after a great hand-to-hand
conflict, King Havelok captured Godrich. The
traitor earl, who had lost a hand in the fray, was sent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg&nbsp;94]</a></span>
bound and fettered to Queen Goldborough, who kept
him, carefully guarded, until he could be tried by his
peers, since (for all his treason) he was still a knight.</p>

<p>When the English recognised their rightful lady
and queen they did homage with great joy, begging
mercy for having resisted their lawful ruler at the
command of a wicked traitor; and the king and queen
pardoned all but Godrich, who was speedily brought
to trial at Lincoln. He was sentenced to be burnt
at the stake, and the sentence was carried out amid
general rejoicings.</p>

<p>Now that vengeance was satisfied, Havelok and his
wife thought of recompensing the loyal helpers who
had believed in them and supported them through
the long years of adversity. Havelok married one
of Grim&rsquo;s daughters to the Earl of Chester, and the
other to Bertram, the good cook, who became Earl
of Cornwall in the place of the felon Godrich and
his disinherited children; the heroic Ubbe was made
Regent of Denmark for Havelok, who decided to stay
and rule England, and all the noble Danish warriors
were rewarded with gifts of gold, and lands and castles.
After a great coronation feast, which lasted for forty
days, King Havelok dismissed the Danish regent and
his followers, and after sad farewells they returned to
their own country. Havelok and Goldborough ruled
England in peace and security for sixty years, and lived
together in all bliss, and had fifteen children, who all
became mighty kings and queens.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI: HOWARD THE HALT</h2>


<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N every society and in all periods the obligations
of family affection and duty to kinsmen have been
recognised as paramount. In the early European
communities a man&rsquo;s first duty was to stand by his
kinsman in strife and to avenge him in death, however
unrighteous the kinsman&rsquo;s quarrel might be.</p>

<p>How pitiful is the aged Priam&rsquo;s lament that he must
needs kiss the hands that slew his dear son Hector, and,
kneeling, clasp the knees of his son&rsquo;s murderer! How
sad is Cuchulain&rsquo;s plaint that his son Connla must go
down to the grave unavenged, since his own father slew
him, all unwitting! One remembers, too, Beowulf&rsquo;s
words: &ldquo;Better it is for every man that he avenge his
friend than that he mourn him much!&rdquo; Since, then,
family affection, the laws of honour and duty, and every
recognised standard of life demanded that a kinsman
should obtain a full wergild (or money payment) for his
relative&rsquo;s death, unless he chose to take up the blood-feud
against the murderer&rsquo;s family, we can hardly
wonder that some of the heroes of early European
literature are heroes of vengeance. Orestes and Electra
are Greek embodiments of the idea of the sacredness of
vengeance for murdered kinsfolk, and similar feelings
are revealed in Gudrun&rsquo;s revenge for the murder of
Siegfried in the &ldquo;Nibelungenlied.&rdquo; To the Teutonic
or Celtic warrior there would be heroism of a noble
type in a just vengeance fully accomplished, and this
heroism would be more easily recognised when the
wrongdoer was rich and powerful, the avenger old,
poor, and friendless. While admitting that the hero
of vengeance belongs to and represents only one side of
the civilisation of a somewhat barbaric community, we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg&nbsp;96]</a></span>
must allow that the elements of dogged perseverance,
dauntless courage, and resolute loyalty in some degree
redeemed the ferocity and cruelty of the blood-feud he
waged against the ill-doer.</p>

<p>It is certain that in the popular Icelandic saga of
&ldquo;Howard the Halt&rdquo; tradition has recorded with minute
detail of approbation the story of a man and woman, old,
weak, friendless, who, in spite of terrible odds, succeeded
in obtaining a late but sufficing vengeance for the cruel
slaughter of their only son, the murderer being the most
powerful man of the region. The part here assigned
to the woman indicates the firm hold which the blood-feud
had gained on the imagination of the Norsemen.</p>


<h3>Icelandic Ghosts</h3>

<p>The story possesses a further interest as revealing
the unique character of the Icelandic ghost or phantom.
In other literatures the spirit returned from the dead
is a thin, immaterial, disembodied essence, a faint
shadow of its former self; in Icelandic legend the
spirit returns in full possession of its body, but more
evil-disposed to mankind than before death. It fights
and wrestles, pummels its adversary black and blue, it
is huge and bloated and hideous, it tries to strangle
men, and leaves finger-marks on their throats. If the
ghosts are those of drowned men, they come home
every night dripping with sea-water, and crowd the
family from the fire and from the hall. Apparently
they are evil spirits animating the dead body, and
nothing but the utter destruction of the body avails
to drive away the malignant spirit.</p>


<h3>The Story. Howard and Thorbiorn</h3>

<p>Thus runs the saga of &ldquo;Howard the Halt&rdquo;:</p>

<p>About the year 1000, when the Christian faith had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg&nbsp;97]</a></span>
hardly yet been heard of in Iceland, there dwelt at
Bathstead, on the shores of Icefirth, in that far-distant
land a mighty chieftain, of royal descent and great
wealth, named Thorbiorn. Though not among the
first settlers of Iceland, he had appropriated much unclaimed
land, and was one of the leading men of the
country-side, but was generally disliked for his arrogance
and injustice. Thorkel, the lawman and arbitrator of
Icefirth, was weak and easily cowed, so Thorbiorn&rsquo;s
wrongdoing remained unchecked; many a maiden had
he betrothed to himself, and afterwards rejected, and
many a man had he ousted from his lands, yet no redress
could be obtained, and no man was bold enough
to attack so great a chieftain or resist his will. Thorbiorn&rsquo;s
house at Bathstead was one of the best in the
district, and his lands stretched down to the shores of
the firth, where he had made a haven with a jetty for
ships. His boathouse stood a little back above a ridge
of shingle, and beside a deep pool or lagoon. The
household of Thorbiorn included Sigrid, a fair maiden,
young and wealthy, who was his housekeeper; Vakr,
an ill-conditioned and malicious fellow, Thorbiorn&rsquo;s
nephew; and a strong and trusted serving-man named
Brand. Besides these there were house-carles in plenty,
and labourers, all good fighting-men.</p>

<p>Not far from Bathstead, at Bluemire, dwelt an old
Viking called Howard. He was of honourable descent,
and had won fame in earlier Viking expeditions, but
since he had returned lamed and nearly helpless from
his last voyage he had aged greatly, and men called
him Howard the Halt. His wife, Biargey, however,
was an active and stirring woman, and their only son,
Olaf, bade fair to become a redoubtable warrior. Though
only fifteen, Olaf had reached full stature, was tall, fair,
handsome, and stronger than most men. He wore his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg&nbsp;98]</a></span>
fair hair long, and always went bareheaded, for his great
bodily strength defied even the bitter winter cold of
Iceland, and he faced the winds clad in summer raiment
only. With all his strength and beauty, Olaf was a
loving and obedient son to Howard and Biargey, and
the couple loved him as the apple of their eye.</p>


<h3>Olaf Meets Sigrid</h3>

<p>The men of Icefirth were wont to drive their sheep
into the mountains during the summer, leave them
there till autumn, and then, collecting the scattered
flocks, to restore to each man his own branded sheep.
One autumn the flocks were wild and shy, and it was
found that many sheep had strayed in the hills. When
those that had been gathered were divided Thorbiorn
had lost at least sixty wethers, and was greatly vexed.
Some weeks later Olaf Howardson went alone into the
hills, and returned with all the lost sheep, having sought
them with great toil and danger. Olaf drove the rest
of the sheep home to their grateful owners, and then
took Thorbiorn&rsquo;s to Bathstead. Reaching the house
at noonday, he knocked on the door, and as all men sat
at their noontide meal, the housekeeper, the fair Sigrid,
went forth herself and saw Olaf.</p>

<p>She greeted him courteously and asked his business,
and he replied, &ldquo;I have brought home Thorbiorn&rsquo;s
wethers which strayed this autumn,&rdquo; and then the two
talked together for a short time. Now Thorbiorn was
curious to know what the business might be, and sent
his nephew Vakr to see who was there; he went
secretly and listened to the conversation between Sigrid
and Olaf, but heard little, for Olaf was just saying, &ldquo;Then
I need not go in to Thorbiorn; thou, Sigrid, canst as
well tell him where his sheep are now&rdquo;; then he simply
bade her farewell and turned away.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 412px;">
<img src="images/hmlbr14.jpg" width="412" height="600" alt="" />
<a name="image_page_98" id="image_page_98"></a>
</div>

<p class="caption">Olaf and Sigrid</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg&nbsp;99]</a></span>
Vakr ran back into the hall, shouting and laughing,
till Thorbiorn asked: &ldquo;How now, nephew! Why
makest thou such outcry? Who is there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was Olaf Howardson, the great booby of Bluemire,
bringing back the sheep thou didst lose in the
autumn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was a neighbourly deed,&rdquo; said Thorbiorn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! but there was another reason for his coming,
I think,&rdquo; said Vakr. &ldquo;He and Sigrid had a long talk
together, and I saw her put her arms round his neck;
she seemed well pleased to greet him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Olaf may be a brave man, but it is rash of him to
anger me thus, by trying to steal away my housekeeper,&rdquo;
said Thorbiorn, scowling heavily. Olaf had no thanks
for his kindness, and was ill received whenever he
came; yet he came often to see Sigrid, for he loved
her, and tried to persuade her to wed him. Thorbiorn
hated him the more for his open wooing, which he
could not forbid.</p>


<h3>Thorbiorn Insults Olaf</h3>

<p>The next year, when harvest was over, and the sheep
were brought home, again most of the missing sheep
belonged to Thorbiorn, and again Olaf went to the
mountains alone and brought back the stray ones. All
thanked him, except the master of Bathstead, to whom
Olaf drove back sixty wethers. Thorbiorn had grown
daily more enraged at Olaf&rsquo;s popularity, his strength
and beauty, and his evident love for Sigrid, and now
chose this opportunity of insulting the bold youth who
rivalled him in fame and in public esteem.</p>

<p>Olaf reached Bathstead at noon, and seeing that all
men were in the hall, he entered, and made his way to the
da&iuml;s where Thorbiorn sat; there he leaned on his axe,
gazed steadily at the master, who gave him no
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg&nbsp;100]</a></span>
single word of greeting. Then every one kept silence
watching them both.</p>

<p>At last Olaf broke the stillness by asking: &ldquo;Why are
you all dumb? There is no honour to those who say
naught. I have stood here long enough and had no
word of courteous greeting. Master Thorbiorn, I have
brought home thy missing sheep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vakr answered spitefully: &ldquo;Yes, we all know that
thou hast become the Icefirth sheep-drover; and we
all know that thou hast come to claim some share of
the sheep, as any other beggar might. Kinsman Thorbiorn,
thou hadst better give him some little alms to
satisfy him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olaf flushed angrily as he answered: &ldquo;Nay, it is not
for that I came; but, Thorbiorn, I will not seek thy
lost sheep a third time.&rdquo; And as he turned and strode
indignantly from the hall Vakr mocked and jeered at
him. Yet Olaf passed forth in silence.</p>

<p>The third year Olaf found and brought home all
men&rsquo;s sheep but Thorbiorn&rsquo;s; and then Vakr spread the
rumour that Olaf had stolen them, since he could not
otherwise obtain a share of them. This rumour came
at last to Howard&rsquo;s ears, and he upbraided Olaf, saying,
when his son praised their mutton, &ldquo;Yes, it is good,
and it is really ours, not Thorbiorn&rsquo;s. It is terrible
that we have to bear such injustice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olaf said nothing, but, seizing the leg of mutton, flung
it across the room; and Howard smiled at the wrath
which his son could no longer suppress; perhaps, too,
Howard longed to see Olaf in conflict with Thorbiorn.</p>


<h3>Olaf and the Wizard&rsquo;s Ghost</h3>

<p>While Howard was still upbraiding Olaf a widow
entered, who had come to ask for help in a difficult
matter. Her dead husband (a reputed wizard) returned
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg&nbsp;101]</a></span>
to his house night after night as a dreadful ghost, and
no man would live in the house. Would Howard come
and break the spell and drive away the dreadful nightly
visitant?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; replied Howard, &ldquo;I am no longer young
and strong. Why do you not ask Thorbiorn? He
accounts himself to be chief here, and a chieftain should
protect those in his country-side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said the widow. &ldquo;I am only too glad if
Thorbiorn lets me alone. I will not meddle with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then said Olaf: &ldquo;Father, I will go and try my
strength with this ghost, for I am young and stronger
than most, and I deem such a matter good sport.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Accordingly Olaf went back with the widow, and
slept in the hall that night, with a skin rug over him.
At nightfall the dead wizard came in, ghastly, evil-looking,
and terrible, and tore the skin from over Olaf;
but the youth sprang up and wrestled with the evil
creature, who seemed to have more than mortal strength.
They fought grimly till the lights died out, and the
struggle raged in the darkness up and down the hall,
and finally out of doors. In the yard round the house
the dead wizard fell, and Olaf knelt upon him and
broke his back, and thought him safe from doing any
mischief again. When Olaf returned to the hall men
had rekindled the lights, and all made much of him, and
tended his bruises and wounds, and counted him a hero
indeed. His fame spread through the whole district,
and he was greatly beloved by all men; but Thorbiorn
hated him more than ever.</p>

<p>Soon another quarrel arose, when a stranded whale,
which came ashore on Howard&rsquo;s land, was adjudged to
Thorbiorn. The lawman, Thorkel, was summoned to
decide to whom the whale belonged, and came to view
it. &ldquo;It is manifestly theirs,&rdquo; said he falteringly, for he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg&nbsp;102]</a></span>
dreaded Thorbiorn&rsquo;s wrath. &ldquo;Whose saidst thou?&rdquo;
cried Thorbiorn, coming to him menacingly, with drawn
sword. &ldquo;Thine,&rdquo; said Thorkel, with downcast eyes;
and Thorbiorn triumphantly claimed and took the whale
though the injustice of the decree was evident. Yet
Olaf felt no ill-will to Thorbiorn, for Sigrid&rsquo;s sake, but
contrived to render him another service.</p>


<h3>Olaf&rsquo;s Second Fight with the Ghost</h3>

<p>Brand the Strong, Thorbiorn&rsquo;s shepherd, could not
drive his sheep one day. Olaf met him trying to get
his frightened wethers home: it seemed an impossible
task, because an uncanny human form, with waving
arms, stood in a narrow bend of the path and drove
them back and scattered them. Brand told Olaf all the
tale, and when the two went to look, Olaf saw that the
enemy was the ghost of the dead wizard whom he had
fought before. &ldquo;Which wilt thou do,&rdquo; said Olaf,
&ldquo;fight the wizard or gather thy sheep?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no wish to fight the ghost; I will find my
scattered sheep,&rdquo; said Brand; &ldquo;that is the easier task.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Olaf ran at the ghost, who awaited him at the
top of a high bank, and he and the wizard wrestled
again with each other till they fell from the bank into
a snowdrift, and so down to the sea-shore. There
Olaf, whose strength had been tried to the utmost,
had the upper hand, and again broke the back of the
dead wizard; but, seeing that that had been of no
avail before, he took the body, swam out to sea with it,
and sank it deep in the firth. Ever after men believed
that this part of the coast was dangerous to ships.</p>

<p>Brand thanked the youth much for his help, and
when he reached Bathstead related what Olaf had done
for him. Thorbiorn said nothing, but Vakr sneered,
and called Brand a coward for asking help of Olaf.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg&nbsp;103]</a></span>
The strife grew keen between them, almost to blows,
and was only settled by Thorbiorn, who forbade Brand
to praise Olaf or to accept help from him. His ill-will
grew so evident to all men that Howard the Halt
decided, in spite of Olaf&rsquo;s reluctance, to remove to a
homestead on the other side of the firth, away from
Thorbiorn&rsquo;s neighbourhood.</p>


<h3>Olaf Meets Thorbiorn</h3>

<p>That summer Thorbiorn decided to marry. He
wooed a maiden who was sister of the wise Guest, who
dwelt at the Mead, and Guest agreed to the match,
on condition that Thorbiorn should renounce his
injustice and evil ways; to this Thorbiorn assented,
and the wedding was held shortly after. Thorbiorn
had said nothing to his household of his proposed
marriage, and Sigrid first heard of it when the wedding
was over, and the bridal party would soon be riding
home to Bathstead. Sigrid was very wroth that she
must give up her control of the household to another,
and refused to stay to serve under Thorbiorn&rsquo;s wife;
accordingly she withdrew from Bathstead to a kinsman&rsquo;s
house, taking all her goods with her. Thorbiorn
raged furiously on his return, when he found that she
was gone, for her wealth made a great difference to
his comfort, and threatened dire punishment to all who
had helped her. Olaf continued his wooing of Sigrid,
and went to see her often in her kinsman&rsquo;s abode, and
they loved each other greatly.</p>

<p>One day when Olaf had been seeking some lost sheep
he made his way to Sigrid&rsquo;s house, to talk with her as
usual. As they stood near the house together and
talked Sigrid looked suddenly anxious and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see Thorbiorn and Vakr coming in a boat over
the firth with weapons beside them, and I see the gleam
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg&nbsp;104]</a></span>
of Thorbiorn&rsquo;s great sword Warflame. I fear they have
done, or will do, some evil deed, and therefore I pray
thee, Olaf, not to stay and meet them. He has hated
thee for a long time, and the help thou didst give me
to leave Bathstead did not mend matters. Go thy way
now, and do not fall in with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not afraid,&rdquo; said Olaf. &ldquo;I have done Thorbiorn
no wrong, and I will not flee before him. He is
only one man, as I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; Sigrid replied, &ldquo;how canst thou, a stripling
of eighteen, hope to stand before a grown man, a mighty
champion, armed with a magic sword? Thy words and
thoughts are brave, as thou thyself art, but the odds are
too great for thee: they are two to one, since Vakr,
ever spiteful and malicious, will not stand idle while
thou art in combat with Thorbiorn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Olaf, &ldquo;I will not avoid them, but I
will not seek a contest. If it must be so, I will fight
bravely; thou shalt hear of my deeds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, that will never be; I will not live after thee
to ask of them,&rdquo; said Sigrid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Farewell now; live long and happily!&rdquo; said Olaf;
and so they bade each other farewell, and Olaf left her
there, and went down to the shore where his sheep lay.
Thorbiorn and Vakr had just landed, and they greeted
each other, and Olaf asked them their errand. &ldquo;We
go to my mother,&rdquo; said Vakr.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us go together,&rdquo; replied Olaf, &ldquo;for my way is
the same in part. But I am sorry that I must needs
drive my sheep home, for Icefirth sheep-drovers will
become proud if a great man like thee should join the
trade, Thorbiorn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, I do not mind that,&rdquo; said Thorbiorn; so they
all went on together; and as he went Olaf caught up a
crooked cudgel with which to herd his sheep; he noticed,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg&nbsp;105]</a></span>
too, that Thorbiorn and Vakr kept trying to lag behind
him, and he took care that they all walked abreast.</p>


<h3>The Combat</h3>

<p>When the three came near the house of Thordis,
Vakr&rsquo;s mother, where the ways divided, Thorbiorn
said: &ldquo;Now, nephew Vakr, we need no longer delay
what we would do.&rdquo; And then Olaf knew that he had
fallen into their snare. He ran up a bank beside the
road, and the two set on him from below, and he
defended himself at first manfully with the crooked
cudgel; but Thorbiorn&rsquo;s sword Warflame sliced this
like a stalk of flax, and Olaf had to betake himself to
his axe, and the fight went on for long.</p>


<h3>A New Enemy Comes</h3>

<p>The noise of the fray reached the ears of Thordis,
Vakr&rsquo;s mother, in her house, so that she sent a boy to
learn the cause, and when he told her that Olaf Howardson
was fighting against Thorbiorn and Vakr she bade
her second son go to the help of his kinsfolk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not go,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I would rather fight for
Olaf than for them. It is a shame for two to set on
one man, and they such great champions too. I will
not be the third; I will not go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I know that thou art a coward,&rdquo; sneered his
mother. &ldquo;Daughter, not son, thou art, too timid to
help thy kinsfolk. I will show thee that I am a braver
daughter than thou a son!&rdquo;</p>


<h3>Olaf&rsquo;s Death</h3>

<p>By these words Thordis so enraged her son that he
seized his axe and rushed from the house down the hill
towards Olaf, who could not see the new-comer, because
he stood with his back to the house. Coming close to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg&nbsp;106]</a></span>
Olaf, the new assailant drove the axe in deep between
his shoulders, and when Olaf felt the blow he turned
and with a mighty stroke slew his last enemy. Thereupon
Thorbiorn thrust Olaf through with the sword
Warflame, and he died. Then Thorbiorn took Olaf&rsquo;s
teeth, which he smote from his jaw, wrapped them in a
cloth, and carried them home.</p>

<p>The news of the slaughter was at once told by Thorbiorn
(for so long as homicide was not concealed it was
not considered murder), and told fairly, so that all men
praised Olaf for his brave defence, and lamented his
death. But when men sought for the fair Sigrid she
could not be found, and was seen no more from that
day. She had loved Olaf greatly, had seen him fall, and
could not live when he was dead; but no man knew
where she died or was buried.</p>

<p>The terrible news of Olaf&rsquo;s death came to Howard,
and he sighed heavily and took to his bed for grief,
and remained bedridden for twelve months, leaving his
wife Biargey to manage the daily fishing and the farm.
Men thought that Olaf would be for ever unavenged,
because Howard was too feeble, and his adversary too
mighty and too unjust.</p>


<h3>Howard Claims Wergild for Olaf</h3>

<p>When a year had passed away Biargey came to
Howard where he lay in his bed, and bade him arise
and go to Bathstead. Said she:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would have thee claim wergild for our son, since
a man that can no longer fight may well prove his valour
by word of mouth, and if Thorbiorn should show any
sign of justice thou shalt not claim too much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Howard replied: &ldquo;I know it is a bootless errand to
ask justice from Thorbiorn, but I will do thy will in this
matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg&nbsp;107]</a></span>
So Howard went heavily, walking as an old man, to
Bathstead, and, after the usual greetings, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have come to thee, Thorbiorn, on a great matter&mdash;to
claim wergild for my dead son Olaf, whom thou
didst slay guiltless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thorbiorn answered: &ldquo;I have never yet paid a
wergild, though I have slain many men&mdash;some say
innocent men. But I am sorry for thee, since thou hast
lost a brave son, and I will at least give thee something.
There is an old horse named Dodderer out in the
pastures, grey with age, sore-backed, too old to work;
but thou canst take him home, and perhaps he will be
some good, when thou hast fed him up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now Howard was angered beyond speech. He
reddened and turned straight to the door; and as he
went down the hall Vakr shouted and jeered; but
Howard said no word, good or bad. He returned
home, and took to his bed for another year.</p>

<p class="caption">Howard leaves the house of Thorbiorn</p>


<h3>Howard at the Thing</h3>

<p>In the second year Biargey again urged Howard to
try for a wergild. She suggested that he should follow
Thorbiorn to the Thing and try to obtain justice, for
men loathed Thorbiorn&rsquo;s evil ways, and Howard would
be sure to have many sympathizers. Howard was loath
to go. &ldquo;Thorbiorn, my son&rsquo;s slayer, has mocked me
once; shall he mock me again where all the chieftains
are assembled? I will not go to endure such shame!&rdquo;</p>

<p>To his surprise, Biargey urged her will, saying:
&ldquo;Thou wilt have friends, I know, since Guest will be
there, and he is a just man, and will strive to bring
about peace between thee and Thorbiorn. And hearken
to me, and heed my words, husband! If Thorbiorn is
condemned to pay thee money, and there is a large
ring of assessors, it may be that when thou and he are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg&nbsp;108]</a></span>
in the ring together he will do something to grieve
thee sorely. Then look thou well to it! If thy heart
be light, make thou no peace; I am somewhat foresighted,
and I know that then Olaf shall be avenged.
But if thou be heavy-hearted, then do thou be reconciled
to Thorbiorn, for I know that Olaf shall lie
unatoned for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Howard replied: &ldquo;Wife, I understand thee not,
nor thy words, but this I know: I would do and bear
all things if I might but obtain due vengeance for Olaf&rsquo;s
death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last Howard, impressed by his wife&rsquo;s half-prophetic
words, roused himself, and rode away to the
Thing; here he found shelter with a great chieftain,
Steinthor of Ere, who was kind to the old man, and
gave Howard a place in his booth. Steinthor praised
Olaf&rsquo;s courage and manful defence, and bade his
followers cherish the old man, and not arouse his grief
for his dead son.</p>


<h3>Howard and Thorbiorn</h3>

<p>As the days wore on Howard did nothing towards
obtaining compensation for his great loss, until Steinthor
asked him why he took no action in the matter. Howard
replied that he felt helpless against Thorbiorn&rsquo;s evil
words and deeds; but Steinthor bade him try to win
Guest to his side&mdash;then he would succeed. Howard
took heart, and set off for the booth which Thorbiorn
shared with Guest; but unhappily Guest was not there
when Howard came. Thorbiorn greeted him and asked
what matter had brought him, and Howard replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My grief for Olaf is yet deep in my heart; still I
remember his death; and now again I come to claim a
wergild for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thorbiorn answered: &ldquo;Come to me at home in my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg&nbsp;109]</a></span>
own country, and I may do somewhat for thee, but I
will not have thee whining against me here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Howard said: &ldquo;If thou wilt do nothing here, I have
proved that thou wilt do still less in thine own country;
but I had hoped for help from other chieftains.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thorbiorn burst out wrathfully: &ldquo;See! He will
stir up other men against me! Get thee gone, old man,
or thou shalt not escape a beating.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now Howard was greatly angered, and said: &ldquo;Yes, old
I am&mdash;too old and feeble to win respect; but the days
have been when I would not have endured such wrong;
yea, and if Olaf were still alive thou wouldst not have
flouted me thus.&rdquo; As he left Thorbiorn&rsquo;s sight his
grief and anger were so great that he did not notice
Guest returning, but went heavily to Steinthor&rsquo;s booth,
where he told all Thorbiorn&rsquo;s injustice, and won much
sympathy.</p>


<h3>Guest and Howard</h3>

<p>When Guest had entered the booth he sat down
beside Thorbiorn and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was the man whom I met leaving the booth
just now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A wise question for a wise man to ask! How can
I tell? So many come and go,&rdquo; said Thorbiorn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But this was an old man, large of stature, lame in
one knee; yet he looked a brave warrior, and he was so
wrathful that he did not know where he went. He
seemed a man likely to be lucky, too, and not one to be
lightly wronged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That must have been old Howard the Halt,&rdquo; said
Thorbiorn. &ldquo;He is a man from my district, who has
come after me to the Thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! Was it his brave son Olaf whom thou didst
slay guiltless?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg&nbsp;110]</a></span>
&ldquo;Yes, certainly,&rdquo; returned Thorbiorn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How hast thou kept the promise of better ways
which thou didst make when thou didst marry my
sister?&rdquo; he asked; and Thorbiorn sat silent. &ldquo;This
wrong must be amended,&rdquo; said Guest, and sent an
honourable man to bring Howard to him. Howard
at first refused to face Thorbiorn again, but at last
reluctantly consented to meet Guest, and when the
latter had greeted him in friendly and honourable
fashion he told the whole story, from the time of
Thorbiorn&rsquo;s first jealousy of Olaf.</p>

<p>Guest was horrified. &ldquo;Heard ever man such injustice!&rdquo;
he cried. &ldquo;Now, Thorbiorn, choose one
of two things: either my sister shall no longer be thy
wife, or thou shalt allow me to give judgment between
Howard and thee.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>Guest&rsquo;s Judgment and the Payment of the Wergild</h3>

<p>Thorbiorn agreed to leave the matter in Guest&rsquo;s
hands, and many men were called to make a ring as
assessors, that all might be legally done, and Thorbiorn
and Howard stood together in the ring. Then Guest
gave judgment: &ldquo;Thorbiorn, I cannot condemn thee
to pay Howard all thou owest&mdash;with all thy wealth,
thou hast not money enough for that; but for slaying
Olaf thou shalt pay a threefold wergild. For the other
wrongs thou hast done him, I, thy brother-in-law, will
try to atone by gifts, and friendship, and all honour in
my power, as long as we both live; and if he will come
home to stay with me he shall be right welcome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thorbiorn agreed to the award, saying carelessly:
&ldquo;I will pay him at home in my own country, if he
will come to me when I have more leisure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Guest, who distrusted Thorbiorn, &ldquo;thou
shalt pay here, and now, fully; and I myself will pay
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg&nbsp;111]</a></span>
one wergild, to help thee in atonement.&rdquo; When this
was agreed Howard sat down in the ring, and Guest
gave him the one wergild (a hundred of silver), which
Howard received in the skirt of his cloak; and then
Thorbiorn paid one wergild slowly, coin by coin, and said
he had no more money; but Guest bade him pay it all.</p>

<p>Then Thorbiorn drew out a cloth and untied it,
saying, &ldquo;He will surely count himself paid in full if
I give him this!&rdquo; and he flung into the old man&rsquo;s face,
as he sat on the ground, the teeth of the dead Olaf,
saying, &ldquo;Here are thy son&rsquo;s teeth!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Howard sprang up, bleeding, mad with rage and
grief. The silver rolled in all directions from his cloak
as he came to his feet, but he heeded it not at all.
Blinded with blood, and furious, he broke through the
ring of assessors, dashed one of them to earth, and
rushed away like a young man; but when he came to
Steinthor&rsquo;s booth he lay as if dead, and spoke to no
man.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 411px;">
<img src="images/hmlbr16.jpg" width="411" height="600" alt="" />
<a name="image_page_110" id="image_page_110"></a>
</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;The silver rolled in all directions from his cloak&rdquo;</p>

<p>Guest would have no more to do with Thorbiorn.
&ldquo;Thou hast no equal for cruelty and evil; thou
shalt surely repent it,&rdquo; he said; and he rode to
Bathstead, took his sister away, with all her wealth, and
broke off his alliance with Thorbiorn, caring nothing
for the shame he put upon so unjust a man.</p>

<p>Howard went home, told Biargey all that had
happened, and took to his bed again, a poor, old,
helpless, miserable man; but his wife, who saw her
presage beginning to come true, kept up her courage,
rowed out fishing every day, and guided the household
for yet another year.</p>


<h3>Biargey and her Brethren</h3>

<p>That summer, one day, as Biargey was rowed out to
the fishing as usual, she saw Thorbiorn&rsquo;s boat coming
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg&nbsp;112]</a></span>
up the firth, and bade her man take up the lines and
go to meet him, and row round the cutter, while she
talked with Thorbiorn. As Biargey&rsquo;s little boat
approached the cutter Thorbiorn stopped his vessel
for he saw that she would speak with him, and her
boat circled round the cutter while she asked his
business, and learnt that he was going with Vakr to
meet a brother and nephew of his, to bring them to
Bathstead, and that he expected to be away from home
for a week. The little skiff had now passed completely
round the motionless cutter, and Olaf&rsquo;s mother, having
learnt all she wanted, bade her rower quit Thorbiorn;
the little boat shot swiftly and suddenly away, leaving
Thorbiorn with an uneasy sense of witchcraft. So
disquieted did he feel that he would have pursued her
and drowned &ldquo;the old hag,&rdquo; as he called her, had he
not been prevented by Brand the Strong, who had
been helped in his need by Olaf.</p>

<p>As the little craft shot away Biargey smiled mysteriously,
and said to her rower: &ldquo;Now I feel sure that
Olaf my son will be avenged. I have work to do: let
us not go home yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where, then, shall we go?&rdquo; asked the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To my brother Valbrand.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>Valbrand</h3>

<p>Now Valbrand was an old man who had been a
mighty warrior in his youth, but had now settled down
to a life of quiet and peace; he had, however, two
promising sons, well-grown and manly youths. When
Valbrand saw his sister he came to meet her, saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Welcome, sister! Seldom it is that we see thee.
Wilt thou abide with us this night, or is thine errand
one that craves haste?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must be home to-night,&rdquo; she replied, and added
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg&nbsp;113]</a></span>
mysteriously: &ldquo;But there is help I would fain ask of
thee. Wilt thou lend me thy seal-nets? We have not
enough to catch such fish as we need.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Valbrand answered: &ldquo;Willingly, and thou shalt choose
for thyself. Here are three, one old and worn out, two
new and untried; which wilt thou take?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will have the new ones, but I do not need them
yet; keep them ready for the day when I shall send
and ask for them,&rdquo; Biargey replied, and bade Valbrand
farewell, and rowed away to her next brother.</p>


<h3>Thorbrand and Asbrand</h3>

<p>When Howard&rsquo;s wife came to her brother Thorbrand
she was well received by him and his two sons,
and here she asked for the loan of a trout-net, since she
had not enough to catch the fish. Thorbrand offered
her her choice&mdash;one old and worn out, or two new
and untried nets; and again Biargey chose the new
ones, and bade them be ready when the messenger
came.</p>

<p>From her third brother, Asbrand, who had only one
son, Biargey asked a turf-cutter, as hers was not keen
enough to cut all she wanted; again she was offered
her choice, and chose the new, untried cutter, instead of
the old, rusty, notched one. Then Biargey bade farewell
to Asbrand, refusing his offer of hospitality, and
went home to Howard, and told him of her quests and
the promises she had received. The old couple knew
what the promises meant, but they said nothing to each
other about it.</p>


<h3>The Arousing of Howard</h3>

<p>When seven days had passed Biargey came to
Howard, saying: &ldquo;Arise now, and play the man, if thou
wilt ever win vengeance for Olaf. Thou must do it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg&nbsp;114]</a></span>
now or never, since now the opportunity has come.
Knowest thou not that to-day Thorbiorn returns to
Bathstead, and thou must meet him to-day? And
have I not found helpers for thee in my nephews?
Thou wilt not need to face the strife alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hereupon Howard sprang up joyfully from his bed,
and was no longer lame or halt, nor looked like an old
man, but moved briskly, clad himself in good armour,
and seemed a mighty warrior. His joy broke forth in
words, and he chanted songs of gladness in vengeance,
and joy in strife, and evil omen to the death-doomed
foe. Thus gladly, with spear in hand, he went forth to
find his enemy and avenge his son; but he turned and
kissed his brave wife farewell, for he said: &ldquo;It may
well be that we shall not meet again.&rdquo; Biargey said:
&ldquo;Nay, we shall meet again, for I know that thou
bearest a bold heart and a strong arm, and wilt do
valiantly.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>Howard Gathers his Friends</h3>

<p>Howard and one fighting-man took their boat and
rowed to Valbrand&rsquo;s house, and saw him and his sons
making hay. Valbrand greeted Howard well, for he
had not seen him for long, and begged him to stay
there, but Howard would not. &ldquo;I am in haste, and
have come to fetch the two new seal-nets thou didst
lend to my wife,&rdquo; he said; and Valbrand understood him
well. He called to his sons, &ldquo;Come hither, lads; here
is your kinsman Howard, with mighty work on hand,&rdquo;
and the two youths ran up hastily, leaving their hay-making.
Valbrand went to the house, and returned
bearing good weapons, which he gave to his sons,
bidding them follow their kinsman Howard and help
in his vengeance.</p>

<p>They three went down to the boat, took their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg&nbsp;115]</a></span>
seats beside Howard&rsquo;s man, and rowed to Asbrand&rsquo;s
house. There Howard asked for the promised new
turf-cutter, and Asbrand&rsquo;s son, a tall and manly youth,
joined the party. At their next visit, to Thorbrand&rsquo;s
house, Howard asked for the two trout-nets, and
Thorbrand&rsquo;s two sons, with one stout fighting-man,
came gladly with their kinsman.</p>


<h3>Howard&rsquo;s Plan</h3>

<p>As they rowed away together one of the youths
asked: &ldquo;Why is it that thou hast no sword or axe, Uncle
Howard?&rdquo; Howard replied: &ldquo;It may be that we shall
meet Thorbiorn, and when the meeting is over I shall
not be a swordless man, but it is likely that I shall have
Warflame, that mighty weapon, the best of swords; and
here I have a good spear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These words seemed to them all a good omen, and as
they rowed towards Bathstead they saw a flock of ravens,
which encouraged them yet more, since the raven was the
bird of Odin, the haunter of fields of strife and bloodshed.</p>

<p>When they reached Bathstead they sprang on the
jetty, carried their boat over the ridge of shingle to the
quiet pool by the boathouse, and hid themselves where
they could see, but remain themselves unseen. Howard
took command, and appointed their places, bidding them
be wary, and not stir till he gave the word.</p>


<h3>Thorbiorn&rsquo;s Return</h3>

<p>Late that evening, just before dusk, Thorbiorn and
Vakr came home, bringing their kinsmen with them, a
party of ten in all. They had no suspicion of any
ambush, and Thorbiorn said to Vakr: &ldquo;It is a fine night,
and dry, Vakr; we will leave the boat here&mdash;she will
take no hurt through the night&mdash;and thou shalt carry
our swords and spears up to the boathouse.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg&nbsp;116]</a></span>
Vakr obeyed, and bore all the weapons to the boathouse.
Howard&rsquo;s men would have slain him then but
Howard forbade, and let him return to the jetty for
more armour. When Vakr had gone back Howard
sent to the boathouse for the magic sword, Warflame;
drawing it, he gripped it hard and brandished it, for he
would fain avenge Olaf with the weapon which had
slain him. When Vakr came towards the ambush a
second time he was laden with shields and helmets.
Howard&rsquo;s men sprang up to take him, and he turned to
flee as he saw and heard them. But his foot slipped, and
he fell into the pool, and lay there weighed down by all
the armour, till he died miserably&mdash;a fitting end for one
so ignoble and cruel.</p>


<h3>Thorbiorn&rsquo;s Death</h3>

<p>Howard&rsquo;s men shouted and waved their weapons,
and ran down to the beach to attack their enemies;
but Thorbiorn, seeing them, flung himself into the
sea, swimming towards a small rocky islet. When
Howard saw this he took Warflame between his teeth,
and, old as he was, plunged into the waves and pursued
Thorbiorn. The latter had, however, a considerable
start, and was both younger and stronger than his
adversary, so that he was already on the rock and
prepared to dash a huge stone at Howard, when the old
man reached the islet. Now there seemed no hope for
Howard, but still he clung fiercely to the rock and
strove to draw himself up on the land. Thorbiorn
lifted the huge stone to cast at his foe, but his foot
slipped on the wet rocks, and he fell backward; before
he could recover his footing Howard rushed forward
and slew him with his own sword Warflame, striking
out his teeth, as Thorbiorn had done to Olaf.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 413px;">

<a name="image_page_116" id="image_page_116"></a>
</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;Thorbiorn lifted the huge stone&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Howard swam back to Bathstead, and they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg&nbsp;117]</a></span>
told him that in all six of Thorbiorn&rsquo;s men were dead,
while he had only lost one serving-man, he rejoiced
greatly; but his vengeance was not satisfied until he
had slain yet another brother of Thorbiorn&rsquo;s.</p>


<h3>Steinthor Shelters Howard</h3>

<p>Then, with the news of this great revenge to be told,
Howard and his kinsmen took refuge with that Steinthor
who had given him help and shelter during the Thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are ye, and what tidings do ye bring?&rdquo; asked
Steinthor as the little party of seven entered his hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Howard, and these are my kinsmen,&rdquo; said
Howard. &ldquo;We tell the slaying of Thorbiorn and his
brothers, his nephews and his house-carles, eight in all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Steinthor exclaimed in surprise: &ldquo;Art thou that
Howard, old and bedridden, who didst seem like to
die last year at the Thing, and hast thou done these
mighty deeds with only these youths to aid thee?
This is a great marvel, nearly as wondrous as thy
restoration to youth and health. Great enmity will ye
have aroused against you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Said Howard: &ldquo;Bethink thee that thou didst
promise me thy help if I should ever need it. Therefore
have I come to thee now, because I have some
little need of aid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Steinthor laughed. &ldquo;A little help! When dost thou
think thou wilt need much, if this be not the time?
But bide ye all here in honour, and I will set the matter
right, since thou and these thy helpers have done so
valiantly.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The Thing and Guest&rsquo;s Award</h3>

<p>Howard and his kinsmen abode long with their host,
until the Thing met again; then Steinthor rode away,
leaving the uncle and nephews under good safeguard.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg&nbsp;118]</a></span>
It was a great meeting, with many cases to judge.
When the matter of the death of Thorbiorn&rsquo;s family
was brought up Steinthor spoke on Howard&rsquo;s behalf,
and offered to let Guest again give judgment, since
he had done so before. This offer was accepted by
Thorbiorn&rsquo;s surviving kinsfolk, and Guest, as before,
gave a fair award.</p>

<p>Since a threefold wergild was still due to Howard
for the slaying of Olaf, three of the eight dead need
not be paid for. Thorbiorn, Vakr, and that brother
of his slain by Olaf should continue unatoned for,
because they were evildoers, and fell in an unrighteous
quarrel of their own seeking; moreover, the slaying
of Howard&rsquo;s serving-man cancelled one wergild; there
remained, therefore, but one wergild for Howard to
pay&mdash;one hundred of silver&mdash;which was paid out of
hand. In addition to this, Howard must change his
dwelling, and his nephews must travel abroad for some
years. This sentence pleased all men greatly, and they
broke up the Thing in great content, and Howard rode
home at the head of a goodly company to his stout-hearted
wife Biargey, who had kept his house and lands
in good order all this time. They made a great feast,
and gave rich gifts to all their friends and kinsmen;
then when the farewells were over the exiles went
abroad and did valiantly in Norway; but Howard sold
his lands and moved to another part of the island.
There he prospered greatly; and when he died his
memory was handed down as that of a mighty warrior
and a valiant and prudent man.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII: ROLAND, THE HERO
OF EARLY FRANCE</h2>


<h3>The Roland Legends</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">C</span>HARLES THE GREAT, King of the Franks,
world-famous as Charlemagne, won his undying
renown by innumerable victories for
France and for the Church. Charles as the head of the
Holy Roman Empire and the Pope as the head of the
Holy Catholic Church equally dominated the imagination
of the medi&aelig;val world. Yet in romance Charlemagne&rsquo;s
fame has been eclipsed by that of his illustrious
nephew and vassal, Roland, whose crowning glory has
sprung from his last conflict and heroic death in the
valley of Roncesvalles.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Oh for a blast of that dread horn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Fontarabian echoes borne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That to King Charles did come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Roland brave, and Olivier,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every paladin and peer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Roncesvalles died.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="author">Scott.</p>

<p>Briefly, the historical facts are these: In <small>A.D.</small> 778
Charles was returning from an expedition into Spain,
where the dissensions of the Moorish rulers had
offered him the chance of extending his borders while
he fought for the Christian faith against the infidel.
He had taken Pampeluna, but had been checked before
Saragossa, and had not ventured beyond the Ebro;
he was now making his way home through the
Pyrenees. When the main army had safely traversed
the passes, the rear was suddenly attacked by an
overwhelming body of mountaineers, Gascons and
Basques, who, resenting the violation of their mountain
sanctuaries, and longing for plunder, drove the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg&nbsp;120]</a></span>
Frankish rearguard into a little valley (now marked by
the chapel of Ibagneta and still called Roncesvalles),
and there slew every man.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 428px;">

<a name="image_page_120" id="image_page_120"></a>
</div>

<p class="caption">Charlemagne<br />
Stella Langdale</p>


<h3>The Historic Basis</h3>

<p>The whole romantic legend of Roland has sprung
from the simple words in a contemporary chronicle,
&ldquo;In which battle was slain Roland, prefect of the
marches of Brittany.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>This same fight of Roncesvalles was the theme of
an archaic poem, the &ldquo;Song of Altobiscar,&rdquo; written
about 1835. In it we hear the exultation of the Basques
as they see the knights of France fall beneath their
onslaughts. The Basques are on the heights&mdash;they
hear the trampling of a mighty host which throngs
the narrow valley below: its numbers are as countless
as the sands of the sea, its movement as resistless
as the waves which roll those sands on the shore.
Awe fills the bosoms of the mountain tribesmen, but
their leader is undaunted. &ldquo;Let us unite our strong
arms!&rdquo; he cries aloud. &ldquo;Let us tear our rocks from
their beds and hurl them upon the enemy! Let us
crush and slay them all!&rdquo; So said, so done: the
rocks roll plunging into the valley, slaying whole
troops in their descent. &ldquo;And what mangled flesh,
what broken bones, what seas of blood! Soon of
that gallant band not one is left alive; night covers
all, the eagles devour the flesh, and the bones whiten
in this valley to all eternity!&rdquo;</p>


<h3>A Spanish Version</h3>

<p>So runs the &ldquo;Song of Altobiscar.&rdquo; But Spain too
claims part of the honour of the day of Roncesvalles.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg&nbsp;121]</a></span>
True, Roland was in reality slain by Basques, not by
Spaniards; but Spain, eager to share the honour, has
glorified a national hero, Bernardo del Carpio, who, in
the Spanish legend, defeats Roland in single combat
and wins the day.</p>


<h3>The Italian Orlando</h3>

<p>Italy has laid claim to Roland, and in the guise of
Orlando, Orlando Furioso, Orlando Innamorato, has
made him into a fantastic, chivalrous knight, a hero of
many magical adventures.</p>


<h3>Roland in French Literature</h3>

<p>Noblest of all, however, is the development of the
&ldquo;Roland Saga&rdquo; in French literature; for, even setting
aside much legendary lore and accumulated tradition,
the Roland of the old epic is a perfect hero of the
early days of feudalism, when chivalry was in its very
beginnings, before the cult of the Blessed Virgin Mary
added the grace of courtesy to its heroism. Evidently
Roland had grown in importance before the &ldquo;Chanson
de Roland&rdquo; took its present form, for we find the
rearguard skirmish magnified into a great battle, which
manifestly contains recollections of later Saracen invasions
and Gascon revolts. As befits the hero of an
epic, Roland is now of royal blood, the nephew of the
great emperor, who has himself increased in age and
splendour; this heroic Roland can obviously only be
overcome by the treachery of one of the Franks themselves,
so there appears the traitor Ganelon (a Romance
version of a certain Danilo or Nanilo), who is among
the Twelve Peers what Judas was among the Apostles;
the mighty Saracens, not the insignificant Basques, are
now the victors; and the vengeance taken by Charlemagne
on the Saracens and on the traitor is boldly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg&nbsp;122]</a></span>
added to history, which leaves the disaster unavenged.
Thus the bare fact was embroidered over gradually by
the historical imagination, aided by patriotism, until
a really national hero was evolved out of an obscure
Breton count.</p>


<h3>The &ldquo;Chanson de Roland&rdquo;</h3>

<p>The &ldquo;Song of Roland,&rdquo; as we now have it, seems to
be a late version of an Anglo-Norman poem, made by
a certain Turoldus or Thorold; and it must bear a
close resemblance to that chant which fired the soldiers
of William the Norman at Hastings, when</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Song of Roland&rdquo; bears an intimate relation to
the development of European thought, and the hero
is doubly worth our study as hero and as type of
national character. Thus runs the story:</p>


<h3>The Story</h3>

<p>The Emperor Charles the Great, Carolus Magnus,
or Charlemagne, had been for seven years in Spain,
and had conquered it from sea to sea, except Saragossa,
which, among its lofty mountains, and ruled by its
brave king Marsile, had defied his power. Marsile
still held to his idols, Mahomet, Apollo, and Termagaunt,
dreading in his heart the day when Charles
would force him to become a Christian.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg&nbsp;123]</a></span></p>

<h3>The Saracen Council</h3>

<p>The Saracen king gathered a council around him,
as he reclined on a seat of blue marble in the shade of
an orchard, and asked the advice of his wise men.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;My lords,&rsquo; quoth he, &lsquo;you know our grievous state.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mighty Charles, great lord of France the fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has spread his hosts in ruin o&rsquo;er our land.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No armies have I to resist his course,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No people have I to destroy his hosts.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Advise me now, what counsel shall I take<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To save my race and realm from death and shame?&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>


<h3>Blancandrin&rsquo;s Advice</h3>

<p>A wily emir, Blancandrin, of Val-Fonde, was the
only man who replied. He was wise in counsel, brave
in war, a loyal vassal to his lord.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Fear not, my liege,&rsquo; he answered the sad king.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Send thou to Charles the proud, the arrogant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And offer fealty and service true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With gifts of lions, bears, and swift-foot hounds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seven hundred camels, falcons, mules, and gold&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As much as fifty chariots can convey&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, gold enough to pay his vassals all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say thou thyself will take the Christian faith,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And follow him to Aix to be baptized.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If he demands thy hostages, then I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And these my fellows give our sons to thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To go with Charles to France, as pledge of truth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou wilt not follow him, thou wilt not yield<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be baptized, and so our sons must die;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But better death than life in foul disgrace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With loss of our bright Spain and happy days.&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So cried the pagans all; but Marsile sat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thoughtful, and yet at last accepted all.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>


<h3>An Embassy to Charlemagne</h3>

<p>Now King Marsile dismissed the council with words
of thanks, only retaining near him ten of his most
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg&nbsp;124]</a></span>
famous barons, chief of whom was Blancandrin; to
them he said: &ldquo;My lords, go to Cordova, where Charles
is at this time. Bear olive-branches in your hands, in
token of peace, and reconcile me with him. Great shall
be your reward if you succeed. Beg Charles to have
pity on me, and I will follow him to Aix within a
month, will receive the Christian law, and become his
vassal in love and loyalty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; said Blancandrin, &ldquo;you shall have a good
treaty!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ten messengers departed, bearing olive-branches
in their hands, riding on white mules, with reins of
gold and saddles of silver, and came to Charles as he
rested after the siege of Cordova, which he had just
taken and sacked.</p>


<h3>Reception by Charlemagne</h3>

<p>Charlemagne was in an orchard with his Twelve
Peers and fifteen thousand veteran warriors of France.
The messengers from the heathen king reached this
orchard and asked for the emperor; their gaze
wandered over groups of wise nobles playing at chess,
and groups of gay youths fencing, till at last it rested
on a throne of solid gold, set under a pine-tree and
overshadowed with eglantine. There sat Charles, the
king who ruled fair France, with white flowing beard
and hoary head, stately of form and majestic of countenance.
No need was there of usher to cry: &ldquo;Here
sits Charles the King.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 409px;">
<img src="images/hmlbr19.jpg" width="409" height="600" alt="" />
<a name="image_page_124" id="image_page_124"></a>
</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;Here sits Charles the King&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ambassadors greeted Charlemagne with all
honour, and Blancandrin opened the embassy thus:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peace be with you from God the Lord of Glory
whom you adore! Thus says the valiant King Marsile:
He has been instructed in your faith, the way of salvation,
and is willing to be baptized; but you have been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg&nbsp;125]</a></span>
too long in our bright Spain, and should return to Aix.
There will he follow you and become your vassal,
holding the kingdom of Spain at your hand. Gifts
have we brought from him to lay at your feet, for he
will share his treasures with you!&rdquo;</p>


<h3>He is Perplexed</h3>

<p>Charlemagne raised his hands in thanks to God, but
then bent his head and remained thinking deeply, for
he was a man of prudent mind, cautious and far-seeing,
and never spoke on impulse. At last he said proudly:
&ldquo;Ye have spoken fairly, but Marsile is my greatest
enemy: how can I trust your words?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blancandrin replied: &ldquo;He will give hostages, twenty
of our noblest youths, and my own son will be
among them. King Marsile will follow you to the
wondrous springs of Aix-la-Chapelle, and on the feast
of St. Michael will receive baptism in your court.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus the audience ended. The messengers were
feasted in a pavilion raised in the orchard, and the
night passed in gaiety and good-fellowship.</p>


<h3>He Consults his Twelve Peers</h3>

<p>In the early morning Charlemagne arose and heard
Mass; then, sitting beneath a pine-tree, he called the
Twelve Peers to council. There came the twelve
heroes, chief of them Roland and his loyal brother-in-arms
Oliver; there came Archbishop Turpin; and,
among a thousand loyal Franks, there came Ganelon
the traitor. When all were seated in due order
Charlemagne began:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lords and barons, I have received an embassy
of peace from King Marsile, who sends me great gifts
and offers, but on condition that I leave Spain and
return to Aix. Thither will he follow me, to receive
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg&nbsp;126]</a></span>
the Faith, become a Christian and my vassal. Is he
to be trusted?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us beware,&rdquo; cried all the Franks.</p>


<h3>Roland Speaks</h3>

<p>Roland, ever impetuous, now rose without delay, and
spoke: &ldquo;Fair uncle and sire, it would be madness to
trust Marsile. Seven years have we warred in Spain,
and many cities have I won for you, but Marsile has
ever been treacherous. Once before when he sent
messengers with olive-branches you and the French
foolishly believed him, and he beheaded the two counts
who were your ambassadors to him. Fight Marsile to
the end, besiege and sack Saragossa, and avenge those
who perished by his treachery.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>Ganelon Objects</h3>

<p>Charlemagne looked out gloomily from under his
heavy brows, he twisted his moustache and pulled his
long white beard, but said nothing, and all the Franks
remained silent, except Ganelon, whose hostility to
Roland showed clearly in his words:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sire, blind credulity were wrong and foolish, but
follow up your own advantage. When Marsile offers
to become your vassal, to hold Spain at your hand and
to take your faith, any man who urges you to reject
such terms cares little for our death! Let pride no
longer be your counsellor, but hear the voice of
wisdom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The aged Duke Naimes, the Nestor of the army,
spoke next, supporting Ganelon: &ldquo;Sire, the advice of
Count Ganelon is wise, if wisely followed. Marsile
lies at your mercy; he has lost all, and only begs for
pity. It would be a sin to press this cruel war, since
he offers full guarantee by his hostages. You need
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg&nbsp;127]</a></span>
only send one of your barons to arrange the terms of
peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This advice pleased the whole assembly, and a
murmur was heard: &ldquo;The Duke has spoken well.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>&ldquo;Who Shall Go to Saragossa?&rdquo;</h3>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;My lords and peers, whom shall we send<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Saragossa to Marsile?&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Sire, let me go,&rsquo; replied Duke Naimes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Give me your glove and warlike staff.&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;No!&rsquo; cried the king, &lsquo;my counsellor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt not leave me unadvised&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sit down again; I bid thee stay.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;My lords and peers, whom shall we send<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Saragossa to Marsile?&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Sire, I can go,&rsquo; quoth Roland bold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;That canst thou not,&rsquo; said Oliver;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Thy heart is far too hot and fierce&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I fear for thee. But I will go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If that will please my lord the King.&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;No!&rsquo; cried the king, &lsquo;ye shall not go.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I swear by this white flowing beard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No peer shall undertake the task.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;My lords and peers, whom shall we send?&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Archbishop Turpin rose and spoke:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Fair sire, let me be messenger.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your nobles all have played their part;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give me your glove and warlike staff,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I will show this heathen king<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In frank speech how a true knight feels.&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But wrathfully the king replied:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;By this white beard, thou shalt not go!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sit down, and raise thy voice no more.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>


<h3>Roland Suggests Ganelon</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Knights of France,&rdquo; quoth Charlemagne, &ldquo;choose
me now one of your number to do my errand to
Marsile, and to defend my honour valiantly, if
need be.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg&nbsp;128]</a></span>
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Roland, &ldquo;then it must be Ganelon, my
stepfather; for whether he goes or stays, you have
none better than he!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This suggestion satisfied all the assembly, and they
cried: &ldquo;Ganelon will acquit himself right manfully.
If it please the King, he is the right man to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Charlemagne thought for a moment, and then, raising
his head, beckoned to Ganelon. &ldquo;Come hither,
Ganelon,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and receive this glove and staff,
which the voice of all the Franks gives to thee.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>Ganelon is Angry</h3>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Ganelon, wrathfully. &ldquo;This is the
work of Roland, and I will never forgive him, nor his
friends, Oliver and the other Peers. Here, in your
presence, I bid them defiance!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your anger is too great,&rdquo; said Charlemagne; &ldquo;you
will go, since it is my will also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I shall go, but I shall perish as did your two
former ambassadors. Sire, forget not that your sister
is my wife, and that Baldwin, my son, will be a valiant
champion if he lives. I leave to him my lands and
fiefs. Sire, guard him well, for I shall see him no
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your heart is too tender,&rdquo; said Charlemagne.
&ldquo;You must go, since such is my command.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>He Threatens Roland</h3>

<p>Ganelon, in rage and anguish, glared round the
council, and his face drew all eyes, so fiercely he looked
at Roland.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madman,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;all men know that I am thy
stepfather, and for this cause thou hast sent me to
Marsile, that I may perish! But if I return I will be
revenged on thee.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg&nbsp;129]</a></span>
&ldquo;Madness and pride,&rdquo; Roland retorted, &ldquo;have no
terrors for me; but this embassy demands a prudent
man not an angry fool: if Charles consents, I will do
his errand for thee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou shalt not. Thou art not my vassal, to do my
work, and Charles, my lord, has given me his commands.
I go to Saragossa; but there will I find some
way to vent my anger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now Roland began to laugh, so wild did his stepfather&rsquo;s
threats seem, and the laughter stung Ganelon
to madness. &ldquo;I hate you,&rdquo; he cried to Roland; &ldquo;you
have brought this unjust choice on me.&rdquo; Then, turning
to the emperor: &ldquo;Mighty lord, behold me ready to
fulfil your commands.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>But is Sent</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Fair Lord Ganelon,&rdquo; spoke Charlemagne, &ldquo;bear
this message to Marsile. He must become my vassal
and receive holy baptism. Half of Spain shall be his
fief; the other half is for Count Roland. If Marsile
does not accept these terms I will besiege Saragossa,
capture the town, and lead Marsile prisoner to Aix,
where he shall die in shame and torment. Take this
letter, sealed with my seal, and deliver it into the
king&rsquo;s own right hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thereupon Charlemagne held out his right-hand
glove to Ganelon, who would fain have refused it. So
reluctant was he to grasp it that the glove fell to the
ground. &ldquo;Ah, God!&rdquo; cried the Franks, &ldquo;what an
evil omen! What woes will come to us from this
embassy!&rdquo; &ldquo;You shall hear full tidings,&rdquo; quoth
Ganelon. &ldquo;Now, sire, dismiss me, for I have no time
to lose.&rdquo; Very solemnly Charlemagne raised his hand
and made the sign of the Cross over Ganelon, and gave
him his blessing, saying, &ldquo;Go, for the honour of Jesus
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg&nbsp;130]</a></span>
Christ, and for your Emperor.&rdquo; So Ganelon took his
leave, and returned to his lodging, where he prepared
for his journey, and bade farewell to the weeping
retainers whom he left behind, though they begged to
accompany him. &ldquo;God forbid,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;that so
many brave knights should die! Rather will I die
alone. You, sirs, return to our fair France, greet
well my wife, guard my son Baldwin, and defend his
fief!&rdquo;</p>


<h3>He Plots with Marsile&rsquo;s Messengers</h3>

<p>Then Ganelon rode away, and shortly overtook the
ambassadors of the Moorish king, for Blancandrin had
delayed their journey to accompany him, and the two
envoys began a crafty conversation, for both were wary
and skilful, and each was trying to read the other&rsquo;s
mind. The wily Saracen began:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah! what a wondrous king is Charles!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How far and wide his conquests range!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The salt sea is no bar to him:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Poland to far England&rsquo;s shores<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He stretches his unquestioned sway;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But why seeks he to win bright Spain?&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Such is his will,&rsquo; quoth Ganelon;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;None can withstand his mighty power!&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;How valiant are the Frankish lords<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But how their counsel wrongs their king<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To urge him to this long-drawn strife&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They ruin both themselves and him!&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;I blame not them,&rsquo; quoth Ganelon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;But Roland, swollen with fatal pride.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Near Carcassonne he brought the King<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An apple, crimson streaked with gold:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Fair sire,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;here at your feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I lay the crowns of all the kings.&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If he were dead we should have peace!&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg&nbsp;131]</a></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;How haughty must this Roland be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who fain would conquer all the earth!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such pride deserves due chastisement!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What warriors has he for the task?&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;The Franks of France,&rsquo; quoth Ganelon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;The bravest warriors &rsquo;neath the sun!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For love alone they follow him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Or lavish gifts which he bestows)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To death, or conquest of the world!&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<a name="image_page_130" id="image_page_130"></a>
</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;Ganelon rode away&rdquo;</p>


<h3>To Betray Roland</h3>

<p>The bitterness in Ganelon&rsquo;s tone at once struck:
Blancandrin, who cast a glance at him and saw the
Frankish envoy trembling with rage. He suddenly
addressed Ganelon in whispered tones: &ldquo;Hast thou
aught against the nephew of Charles? Wouldst thou
have revenge on Roland? Deliver him to us, and
King Marsile will share with thee all his treasures.&rdquo;
Ganelon was at first horrified, and refused to hear more,
but so well did Blancandrin argue and so skilfully did
he lay his snare that before they reached Saragossa and
came to the presence of King Marsile it was agreed
that Roland should be destroyed by their means.</p>


<h3>Ganelon with the Saracens</h3>

<p>Blancandrin and his fellow ambassadors conducted
Ganelon into the presence of the Saracen king, and
announced Charlemagne&rsquo;s peaceable reception of their
message and the coming of his envoy. &ldquo;Let him
speak: we listen,&rdquo; said Marsile.</p>

<p>Ganelon then began artfully: &ldquo;Peace be to you in the
name of the Lord of Glory whom we adore! This is
the message of King Charles: You shall receive the
Holy Christian Faith, and Charles will graciously grant
you one-half of Spain as a fief; the other half he intends
for his nephew Roland (and a haughty partner you will
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg&nbsp;132]</a></span>
find him!). If you refuse he will take Saragossa, lead
you captive to Aix, and give you there to a shameful
death.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>Marsile&rsquo;s Anger</h3>

<p>Marsile&rsquo;s anger was so great at this insulting message
that he sprang to his feet, and would have slain Ganelon
with his gold-adorned javelin; but he, seeing this, half
drew his sword, saying:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Sword, how fair and bright thou art!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come thou forth and view the light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long as I can wield thee here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Charles my Emperor shall not say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I die alone, unwept.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere I fall Spain&rsquo;s noblest blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall be shed to pay my death.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>


<h3>The Saracen Council</h3>

<p>However, strife was averted, and Ganelon received
praise from all for his bold bearing and valiant defiance
of his king&rsquo;s enemy. When quiet was restored he
repeated his message and delivered the emperor&rsquo;s
letter, which was found to contain a demand that the
caliph, Marsile&rsquo;s uncle, should be sent, a prisoner, to
Charles, in atonement for the two ambassadors foully
slain before. The indignation of the Saracen nobles
was intense, and Ganelon was in imminent danger, but,
setting his back against a pine-tree, he prepared to defend
himself to the last. Again the quarrel was stayed, and
Marsile, taking his most trusted leaders, withdrew to a
secret council, whither, soon, Blancandrin led Ganelon.
Here Marsile excused his former rage, and, in reparation,
offered Ganelon a superb robe of marten&rsquo;s fur, which
was accepted; and then began the tempting of the
traitor. First demanding a pledge of secrecy, Marsile
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg&nbsp;133]</a></span>
pitied Charlemagne, so aged and so weary with rule.
Ganelon praised his emperor&rsquo;s prowess and vast power.
Marsile repeated his words of pity, and Ganelon replied
that as long as Roland and the Twelve Peers lived
Charlemagne needed no man&rsquo;s pity and feared no
man&rsquo;s power; his Franks, also, were the best living
warriors. Marsile declared proudly that he could bring
four hundred thousand men against Charlemagne&rsquo;s
twenty thousand French; but Ganelon dissuaded him
from any such expedition.</p>


<h3>Ganelon Plans Treachery</h3>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Not thus will you overcome him;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">&lsquo;How must I entrap Count Roland?&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;When King Charles is in the mountains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He will leave behind his rearguard<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Such a mighty host for conquest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you will have peace henceforward!&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg&nbsp;134]</a></span></p>

<h3>Welcomed by Marsile</h3>

<p>Marsile was overjoyed at the treacherous advice and
embraced and richly rewarded the felon knight. The
death of Roland and the Peers was solemnly sworn
between them, by Marsile on the book of the Law of
Mahomet, by Ganelon on the sacred relics in the
pommel of his sword. Then, repeating the compact
between them, and warning Ganelon against treason to
his friends, Marsile dismissed the treacherous envoy
who hastened to return and put his scheme into
execution.</p>


<h3>Ganelon Returns to Charles</h3>

<p>In the meantime Charles had retired as far as
Valtierra, on his way to France, and there Ganelon
found him, and delivered the tribute, the keys of
Saragossa, and a false message excusing the absence of
the caliph. He had, so Marsile said, put to sea with
three hundred thousand warriors who would not renounce
their faith, and all had been drowned in a
tempest, not four leagues from land. Marsile would
obey King Charles&rsquo;s commands in all other respects.
&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; cried Charlemagne. &ldquo;Ganelon, you
have done well, and shall be well rewarded!&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The French Camp. Charles Dreams</h3>

<p>Now the whole Frankish army marched towards the
Pyrenees, and, as evening fell, found themselves among
the mountains, where Roland planted his banner on the
topmost summit, clear against the sky, and the army
encamped for the night; but the whole Saracen host
had also marched and encamped in a wood not far from
the Franks. Meanwhile, as Charlemagne slept he had
dreams of evil omen. Ganelon, in his dreams, seized
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg&nbsp;135]</a></span>
the imperial spear of tough ash-wood, and broke it, so
that the splinters flew far and wide. In another dream
he saw himself at Aix attacked by a leopard and a bear,
which tore off his right arm; a greyhound came to his
aid but he knew not the end of the fray, and slept
unhappily.</p>


<h3>A Morning Council</h3>

<p>When morning light shone, and the army was ready
to march, the clarions of the host sounded gaily, and
Charlemagne called his barons around him.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;My lords and Peers, ye see these strait defiles:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Choose ye to whom the rearguard shall be given.&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;My stepson Roland,&rsquo; straight quoth Ganelon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;&rsquo;Mid all the Peers there is no braver knight:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In him will lie the safety of your host.&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Charles heard in wrath, and spoke in angry tones:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;What fiendish rage has prompted this advice?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who then will go before me in the van?&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The traitor tarried not, but answered swift:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Ogier the Dane will do that duty best.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>When Roland heard that he was to command the
rearguard he knew not whether to be pleased or not.
At first he thanked Ganelon for naming him. &ldquo;Thanks,
fair stepfather, for sending me to the post of danger.
King Charles shall lose no man nor horse through my
neglect.&rdquo; But when Ganelon replied sneeringly, &ldquo;You
speak the truth, as I know right well,&rdquo; Roland&rsquo;s gratitude
turned to bitter anger, and he reproached the
villain. &ldquo;Ah, wretch! disloyal traitor! thou thinkest
perchance that I, like thee, shall basely drop the glove,
but thou shalt see! Sir King, give me your bow. I
will not let my badge of office fall, as thou didst,
Ganelon, at Cordova. No evil omen shall assail the
host through me.&rdquo;</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg&nbsp;136]</a></span></p>

<h3>Roland for the Rearguard</h3>

<p>Charlemagne was very loath to grant his request, but
on the advice of Duke Naimes, most prudent of counsellors,
he gave to Roland his bow, and offered to leave
with him half the army. To this the champion would
not agree, but would only have twenty thousand Franks
from fair France. Roland clad himself in his shining
armour, laced on his lordly helmet, girt himself with
his famous sword Durendala, and hung round his neck
his flower-painted shield; he mounted his good steed
Veillantif, and took in hand his bright lance with the
white pennon and golden fringe; then, looking like
the Archangel St. Michael, he rode forward, and easy
it was to see how all the Franks loved him and would
follow where he led. Beside him rode the famous
Peers of France, Oliver the bold and courteous, the
saintly Archbishop Turpin, and Count Gautier, Roland&rsquo;s
loyal vassal. They chose carefully the twenty thousand
French for the rearguard, and Roland sent Gautier
with one thousand of their number to search the
mountains. Alas! they never returned, for King
Almaris, a Saracen chief, met and slew them all
among the hills; and only Gautier, sorely wounded
and bleeding to death, returned to Roland in the final
struggle.</p>

<p>Charlemagne spoke a mournful &ldquo;Farewell&rdquo; to his
nephew and the rearguard, and the mighty army began
to traverse the gloomy ravine through the dark masses
of rocks, and to emerge on the other side of the
Pyrenees. All wept, most for joy to set eyes on that
dear land of fair France, which for seven years they
had not seen; but Charles, with a sad foreboding of
disaster, hid his eyes beneath his cloak and wept in
silence.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg&nbsp;137]</a></span></p>

<h3>Charles is Sad</h3>

<p>&ldquo;What grief weighs on your mind, sire?&rdquo; asked the
wise Duke Naimes, riding up beside Charlemagne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mourn for my nephew. Last night in a vision I
saw Ganelon break my trusty lance&mdash;this Ganelon who
has sent Roland to the rear. And now I have left
Roland in a foreign land, and, O God! if I lose him
I shall never find his equal!&rdquo; And the emperor rode
on in silence, seeing naught but his own sad foreboding
visions.</p>


<h3>The Saracen Pursuit</h3>

<p>Meanwhile King Marsile, with his countless Saracens,
had pursued so quickly that the van of the heathen
army soon saw waving the banners of the Frankish
rear. Then as they halted before the strife began, one
by one the nobles of Saragossa, the champions of the
Moors, advanced and claimed the right to measure
themselves against the Twelve Peers of France. Marsile&rsquo;s
nephew received the royal glove as chief champion,
and eleven Saracen chiefs took a vow to slay Roland
and spread the faith of Mahomet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Death to the rearguard! Roland shall die!
Death to the Peers! Woe to France and Charlemagne!
We will bring the Emperor to your feet! You shall
sleep at St. Denis! Down with fair France!&rdquo; Such
were their confident cries as they armed for the conflict;
and on their side no less eager were the Franks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fair Sir Comrade,&rdquo; said Oliver to Roland, &ldquo;methinks
we shall have a fray with the heathen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God grant it,&rdquo; returned Roland. &ldquo;Our duty is to
hold this pass for our king. A vassal must endure for
his lord grief and pain, heat and cold, torment and
death; and a knight&rsquo;s duty is to strike mighty blows,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg&nbsp;138]</a></span>
that men may sing of him, in time to come, no evil
songs. Never shall such be sung of me.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>Oliver Descries the Saracens</h3>

<p>Hearing a great tumult, Oliver ascended a hill and
looked towards Spain, where he perceived the great
pagan army, like a gleaming sea, with shining hauberks
and helms flashing in the sun. &ldquo;Alas! we are betrayed!
This treason is plotted by Ganelon, who put us in
the rear,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Say no more,&rdquo; said Roland;
&ldquo;blame him not in this: he is my stepfather.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now Oliver alone had seen the might of the pagan
array, and he was appalled by the countless multitudes
of the heathens. He descended from the hill and
appealed to Roland.</p>


<h3>Roland will not Blow his Horn</h3>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Comrade Roland, sound your war-horn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your great Olifant, far-sounding:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Charles will hear it and return here.&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Cowardice were that,&rsquo; quoth Roland;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;In fair France my fame were tarnished.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No, these Pagans all shall perish<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I brandish Durendala.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Comrade Roland, sound your war-horn:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Charles will hear it and return here.&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;God forbid it,&rsquo; Roland answered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;That it e&rsquo;er be sung by minstrels<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I was asking help in battle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From my King against these Pagans.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will ne&rsquo;er do such dishonour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To my kinsmen and my nation.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No, these heathen all shall perish<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I brandish Durendala.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Comrade Roland, sound your war-horn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Charles will hear it and return here.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See how countless are the heathen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how small our Frankish troop is!&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg&nbsp;139]</a></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;God forbid it,&rsquo; answered Roland,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;That our fair France be dishonoured<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or by me or by my comrades&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Death we choose, but not dishonour!&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Roland was a valiant hero, but Oliver had prudence
as well as valour, and his advice was that of a good and
careful general. Now he spoke reproachfully.</p>


<h3>It is Too Late</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Roland, if you had sounded your magic horn
the king would soon be here, and we should not
perish! Now look to the heights and to the mountain
passes: see those who surround us. None of us will
see the light of another day!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speak not so foolishly,&rdquo; retorted Roland. &ldquo;Accursed
be all cowards, say I.&rdquo; Then, softening his tone a little,
he continued: &ldquo;Friend and comrade, say no more.
The emperor has entrusted to us twenty thousand
Frenchmen, and not a coward among them. Lay on
with thy lance, Oliver, and I will strike with Durendala.
If I die men shall say: &lsquo;This was the sword of a
noble vassal.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>


<h3>Turpin Blesses the Knights</h3>

<p>Then spoke the brave and saintly Archbishop Turpin.
Spurring his horse, he rode, a gallant figure, to the
summit of a hill, whence he called aloud to the Frankish
knights:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Fair sirs and barons, Charles has left us here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To serve him, or at need to die for him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See, yonder come the foes of Christendom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we must fight for God and Holy Faith.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, say your shrift, and make your peace with Heaven;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will absolve you and will heal your souls;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if you die as martyrs, your true home<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is ready midst the flowers of Paradise!&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg&nbsp;140]</a></span>
The Frankish knights, dismounting, knelt before
Turpin, who blessed and absolved them all, bidding
them, as penance, to strike hard against the heathen.</p>

<p>Then Roland called his brother-in-arms, the brave
and courteous Oliver, and said: &ldquo;Fair brother, I know
now that Ganelon has betrayed us for reward and
Marsile has bought us; but the payment shall be
made with our swords, and Charlemagne will terribly
avenge us.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>&ldquo;Montjoie! Montjoie!&rdquo;</h3>

<p>While the two armies yet stood face to face in battle
array Oliver replied: &ldquo;What good is it to speak?
You would not sound your horn, and Charles cannot
help us; he is not to blame. Barons and lords, ride on
and yield not. In God&rsquo;s name fight and slay, and
remember the war-cry of our Emperor.&rdquo; And at the
words the war-cry of &ldquo;Montjoie! Montjoie!&rdquo; burst
from the whole army as they spurred against the
advancing heathen host.</p>


<h3>The Fray</h3>

<p>Great was the fray that day, deadly was the combat,
as the Moors and Franks crashed together, shouting
their cries, invoking their gods or saints, wielding with
utmost courage sword, lance, javelin, scimitar, or dagger.
Blades flashed, lances were splintered, helms were cloven
in that terrible fight of heroes. Each of the Twelve
Peers did mighty feats of arms. Roland himself slew
the nephew of King Marsile, who had promised to
bring Roland&rsquo;s head to his uncle&rsquo;s feet, and bitter were
the words that Roland hurled at the lifeless body of
his foe, who had but just before boasted that Charlemagne
should lose his right hand. Oliver slew the
heathen king&rsquo;s brother, and one by one the Twelve
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg&nbsp;141]</a></span>
Peers proved their mettle on the twelve champions of
King Marsile, and left them dead or mortally wounded
on the field. Wherever the battle was fiercest and the
danger greatest, where help was most needed, there
Roland spurred to the rescue, swinging Durendala,
and, falling on the heathen like a thunderbolt of war,
turned the tide of battle again and yet again.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Red was Roland, red with bloodshed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Red his corselet, red his shoulders,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Red his arm, and red his charger.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Like the red god Mars he rode through the battle;
and as he went he met Oliver, with the truncheon or
a spear in his grasp.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Friend, what hast thou there?&rsquo; cried Roland.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;In this game &rsquo;tis not a distaff,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a blade of steel thou needest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where is now Hauteclaire, thy good sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Golden-hilted, crystal-pommeled?&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Here,&rsquo; said Oliver; &lsquo;so fight I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I have not time to draw it.&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Friend,&rsquo; quoth Roland, &lsquo;more I love thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ever henceforth than a brother.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>


<h3>The Saracens Perish</h3>

<p>Thus the battle continued, most valiantly contested
by both sides, and the Saracens died by hundreds and
thousands, till all their host lay dead but one man, who
fled wounded, leaving the Frenchmen masters of the
field, but in sorry plight&mdash;broken were their swords and
lances, rent their hauberks, torn and blood-stained their
gay banners and pennons, and many, many of their
brave comrades lay lifeless. Sadly they looked round on
the heaps of corpses, and their minds were filled with
grief as they thought of their companions, of fair France
which they should see no more, and of their emperor
who even now awaited them while they fought and died
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg&nbsp;142]</a></span>
for him. Yet they were not discouraged; loudly their
cry re-echoed, &ldquo;Montjoie! Montjoie!&rdquo; as Roland
cheered them on, and Turpin called aloud: &ldquo;Our men
are heroes; no king under heaven has better. It is
written in the Chronicles of France that in that great
land it is our king&rsquo;s right to have valiant soldiers.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>A Second Saracen Army</h3>

<p>While they sought in tears the bodies of their friends,
the main army of the Saracens, under King Marsile in
person, came upon them; for the one fugitive who had
escaped had urged Marsile to attack again at once, while
the Franks were still weary. The advice seemed good
to Marsile, and he advanced at the head of a hundred
thousand men, whom he now hurled against the French
in columns of fifty thousand at a time; and they came
on right valiantly, with clarions sounding and trumpets
blowing.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Soldiers of the Lord,&rsquo; cried Turpin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Be ye valiant and steadfast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this day shall crowns be given you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Midst the flowers of Paradise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the name of God our Saviour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be ye not dismayed nor frighted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest of you be shameful legends<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chanted by the tongue of minstrels.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rather let us die victorious,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since this eve shall see us lifeless!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heaven has no room for cowards!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knights, who nobly fight, and vainly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye shall sit amid the holy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the blessed fields of Heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On then, Friends of God, to glory!&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>And the battle raged anew, with all the odds against the
small handful of French, who knew they were doomed,
and fought as though they were &ldquo;fey.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg&nbsp;143]</a></span></p>

<h3>Gloomy Portents</h3>

<p>Meanwhile the whole course of nature was disturbed.
In France there were tempests of wind and thunder,
rain and hail; thunderbolts fell everywhere, and the
earth shook exceedingly. From Mont St. Michel to
Cologne, from Besan&ccedil;on to Wissant, not one town
could show its walls uninjured, not one village its houses
unshaken. A terrible darkness spread over all the
land, only broken when the heavens split asunder with
the lightning-flash. Men whispered in terror: &ldquo;Behold
the end of the world! Behold the great Day of Doom!&rdquo;
Alas! they knew not the truth: it was the great mourning
for the death of Roland.</p>


<h3>Many French Knights Fall</h3>

<p>In this second battle the French champions were
weary, and before long they began to fall before the
valour of the newly arrived Saracen nobles. First died
Engelier the Gascon, mortally wounded by the lance
of that Saracen who swore brotherhood to Ganelon;
next Samson, and the noble Duke Anseis. These three
were well avenged by Roland and Oliver and Turpin.
Then in quick succession died Gerin and Gerier and
other valiant Peers at the hands of Grandoigne, until
his death-dealing career was cut short by Durendala.
Another desperate single combat was won by Turpin,
who slew a heathen emir &ldquo;as black as molten pitch.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The Second Army Defeated</h3>

<p>Finally this second host of the heathens gave way
and fled, begging Marsile to come and succour them;
but now of the victorious French there were but sixty
valiant champions left alive, including Roland, Oliver,
and the fiery prelate Turpin.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg&nbsp;144]</a></span></p>

<h3>A Third Appears</h3>

<p>Now the third host of the pagans began to roll forward
upon the dauntless little band, and in the short
breathing-space before the Saracens again attacked them
Roland cried aloud to Oliver:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Fair Knight and Comrade, see these heroes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Valiant warriors, lying lifeless!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I must mourn for our fair country<br /></span>
<span class="i0">France, left widowed of her barons.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Charles my King, why art thou absent?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brother mine, how shall we send him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mournful tidings of our struggle?&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;How I know not,&rsquo; said his comrade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Better death than vile dishonour.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>


<h3>Roland Willing to Blow his Horn</h3>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Comrade, I will blow my war-horn:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Charles will hear it in the passes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And return with all his army.&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oliver quoth: &lsquo;&rsquo;Twere disgraceful<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To your kinsmen all their life-days.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I urged it, then you would not;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, to sound your horn is shameful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I never will approve it.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>


<h3>Oliver Objects. They Quarrel</h3>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;See, the battle goes against us:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comrade, I shall sound my war-horn.&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oliver replied: &lsquo;O coward!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I urged it, then you would not.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If fair France again shall greet me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You shall never wed my sister;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By this beard of mine I swear it!&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Why so bitter and so wrathful?&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oliver returned: &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis thy fault;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Valour is not kin to madness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Temperance knows naught of fury.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg&nbsp;145]</a></span>
<span class="i0">You have killed these noble champions,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You have slain the Emperor&rsquo;s vassals,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You have robbed us of our conquests.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, your valour, Count, is fatal!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Charles must lose his doughty heroes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And your league with me must finish<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With this day in bitter sorrow.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>


<h3>Turpin Mediates</h3>

<p>Archbishop Turpin heard the dispute, and strove to
calm the angry heroes. &ldquo;Brave knights, be not so
enraged. The horn will not save the lives of these
gallant dead, but it will be better to sound it, that
Charles, our lord and emperor, may return, may
avenge our death and weep over our corpses, may bear
them to fair France, and bury them in the sanctuary,
where the wild beasts shall not devour them.&rdquo; &ldquo;That
is well said,&rdquo; quoth Roland and Oliver.</p>


<h3>The Horn is Blown</h3>

<p>Then at last Roland put the carved ivory horn, the
magic Olifant, to his lips, and blew so loudly that the
sound echoed thirty leagues away. &ldquo;Hark! our men
are in combat!&rdquo; cried Charlemagne; but Ganelon
retorted: &ldquo;Had any but the king said it, that had
been a lie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A second time Roland blew his horn, so violently
and with such anguish that the veins of his temples
burst, and the blood flowed from his brow and from
his mouth. Charlemagne, pausing, heard it again, and
said: &ldquo;That is Roland&rsquo;s horn; he would not sound
it were there no battle.&rdquo; But Ganelon said mockingly:
&ldquo;There is no battle, for Roland is too proud to sound
his horn in danger. Besides, who would dare to attack
Roland, the strong, the valiant, great and wonderful
Roland? No man. He is doubtless hunting, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg&nbsp;146]</a></span>
laughing with the Peers. Your words, my liege, do but
show how old and weak and doting you are. Ride on,
sire; the open country lies far before you.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 413px;">
<img src="images/hmlbr21.jpg" width="413" height="600" alt="" />
<a name="image_page_144" id="image_page_144"></a>
</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;Charlemagne heard it again&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Roland blew the horn for the third time
he had hardly breath to awaken the echoes; but still
Charlemagne heard. &ldquo;How faintly comes the sound!
There is death in that feeble blast!&rdquo; said the emperor;
and Duke Naimes interrupted eagerly: &ldquo;Sire, Roland
is in peril; some one has betrayed him&mdash;doubtless he
who now tries to beguile you! Sire, rouse your host,
arm for battle, and ride to save your nephew.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>Ganelon Arrested</h3>

<p>Then Charlemagne called aloud: &ldquo;Hither, my men.
Take this traitor Ganelon and keep him safe till my
return.&rdquo; And the kitchen folk seized the felon knight,
chained him by the neck, and beat him; then, binding
him hand and foot, they flung him on a sorry nag, to
be borne with them till Charles should demand him at
their hands again.</p>


<h3>Charles Returns</h3>

<p>With all speed the whole army retraced their steps,
turning their faces to Spain, and saying: &ldquo;Ah, if we
could find Roland alive what blows we would strike
for him!&rdquo; Alas! it was too late! Too late!</p>

<p>How lofty are the peaks, how vast and shadowy the
mountains! How dim and gloomy the passes, how
deep the valleys! How swift the rushing torrents!
Yet with headlong speed the Frankish army hastens
back, with trumpets sounding in token of approaching
help, all praying God to preserve Roland till they come.
Alas! they cannot reach him in time! Too late.
Too late!</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg&nbsp;147]</a></span></p>

<h3>Roland Weeps for his Comrades</h3>

<p>Now Roland cast his gaze around on hill and
valley, and saw his noble vassals and comrades lie
dead. As a noble knight he wept for them, saying:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Fair Knights, may God have mercy on your souls!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May He receive you into Paradise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And grant you rest on banks of heavenly flowers!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ne&rsquo;er have I known such mighty men as you.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair France, that art the best of all dear lands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How art thou widowed of thy noble sons!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through me alone, dear comrades, have you died,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet through me no help nor safety comes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God have you in His keeping! Brother, come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let us attack the heathen and win death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or grief will slay me! Death is duty now.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>


<h3>He Fights Desperately</h3>

<p>So saying, he rushed into the battle, slew the only son
of King Marsile, and drove the heathen before him as
the hounds drive the deer. Turpin saw and applauded.
&ldquo;So should a good knight do, wearing good armour
and riding a good steed. He must deal good strong
strokes in battle, or he is not worth a groat. Let a
coward be a monk in some cloister and pray for the
sins of us fighters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marsile in wrath attacked the slayer of his son, but
in vain; Roland struck off his right hand, and Marsile
fled back mortally wounded to Saragossa, while his
main host, seized with panic, left the field to Roland.
However, the caliph, Marsile&rsquo;s uncle, rallied the ranks,
and, with fifty thousand Saracens, once more came
against the little troop of Champions of the Cross,
the three poor survivors of the rearguard.</p>

<p>Roland cried aloud: &ldquo;Now shall we be martyrs for
our faith. Fight boldly, lords, for life or death! Sell
yourselves dearly! Let not fair France be dishonoured
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg&nbsp;148]</a></span>
in her sons. When the Emperor sees us dead with
our slain foes around us he will bless our valour.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>Oliver Falls</h3>

<p>The pagans were emboldened by the sight of the
three alone, and the caliph, rushing at Oliver, pierced
him from behind with his lance. But though mortally
wounded Oliver retained strength enough to slay the
caliph, and to cry aloud: &ldquo;Roland! Roland! Aid me!&rdquo;
then he rushed on the heathen army, doing heroic deeds
and shouting &ldquo;Montjoie! Montjoie!&rdquo; while the
blood ran from his wound and stained the earth blood-red.
At this woeful sight Roland swooned with grief,
and Oliver, faint from loss of blood, and with eyes
dimmed by fast-coming death, distinguished not the
face of his dear friend; he saw only a vague figure
drawing near, and, mistaking it for an enemy, raised his
sword Hauteclaire and gave Roland one last terrible
blow, which clove the helmet, but harmed not the head.
The blow roused Roland from his swoon, and, gazing
tenderly at Oliver, he gently asked him:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Comrade and brother, was that blow designed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To slay your Roland, him who loves you so?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is no vengeance you would wreak on me.&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Roland, I hear you speak, but see you not.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God guard and keep you, friend; but pardon me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blow I struck, unwitting, on your head.&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;I have no hurt,&rsquo; said Roland; &lsquo;I forgive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here and before the judgment-throne of God.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>


<h3>And Dies</h3>

<p>Now Oliver felt the pains of death come upon him.
Both sight and hearing were gone, his colour fled, and,
dismounting, he lay upon the earth; there, humbly
confessing his sins, he begged God to grant him rest
in Paradise, to bless his lord Charlemagne and the fair
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg&nbsp;149]</a></span>
land of France, and to keep above all men his comrade
Roland, his best-loved brother-in-arms. This ended,
he fell back, his heart failed, his head drooped low, and
Oliver the brave and courteous knight lay dead on the
blood-stained earth, with his face turned to the east.
Roland lamented him in gentle words: &ldquo;Comrade, alas
for thy valour! Many days and years have we been
comrades: no ill didst thou to me, nor I to thee: now
thou art dead, &rsquo;tis pity that I live!&rdquo;</p>


<h3>Turpin is Mortally Wounded. The Horn Again</h3>

<p>Turpin and Roland now stood together for a time
and were joined by the brave Count Gautier, whose
thousand men had been slain, and he himself grievously
wounded; he now came, like a loyal vassal, to die with
his lord Roland, and was slain in the first discharge of
arrows which the Saracens shot. Taught by experience,
the pagans kept their distance, and wounded Turpin
with four lances, while they stood some yards away
from the heroes. But when Turpin felt himself
mortally wounded he plunged into the throng of the
heathen, killing four hundred before he fell, and Roland
fought on with broken armour, and with ever-bleeding
head, till in a pause of the deadly strife he took his
horn and again sent forth a feeble dying blast.</p>


<h3>Charles Answers the Horn</h3>

<p>Charlemagne heard it, and was filled with anguish.
&ldquo;Lords, all goes ill: I know by the sound of Roland&rsquo;s
horn he has not long to live! Ride on faster, and let
all our trumpets sound, in token of our approach.&rdquo;
Then sixty thousand trumpets sounded, so that
mountains echoed it and valleys replied, and the
heathen heard it and trembled. &ldquo;It is Charlemagne!
Charles is coming!&rdquo; they cried. &ldquo;If Roland lives till
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg&nbsp;150]</a></span>
he comes the war will begin again, and our bright
Spain is lost.&rdquo; Thereupon four hundred banded
together to slay Roland; but he rushed upon them,
mounted on his good steed Veillantif, and the valiant
pagans fled. But while Roland dismounted to tend the
dying archbishop they returned and cast darts from afar,
slaying Veillantif, the faithful war-horse, and piercing
the hero&rsquo;s armour. Still nearer and nearer sounded the
clarions of Charlemagne&rsquo;s army in the defiles, and the
Saracen host fled for ever, leaving Roland alone, on
foot, expiring, amid the dying and the dead.</p>


<h3>Turpin Blesses the Dead</h3>

<p>Roland made his way to Turpin, unlaced his golden
helmet, took off his hauberk, tore his own tunic to bind
up his grievous wounds, and then gently raising the
prelate, carried him to the fresh green grass, where he
most tenderly laid him down.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah, gentle lord,&rsquo; said Roland, &lsquo;give me leave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To carry here our comrades who are dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom we so dearly loved; they must not lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unblest; but I will bring their corpses here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thou shalt bless them, and me, ere thou die.&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Go,&rsquo; said the dying priest, &lsquo;but soon return.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thank God! the victory is yours and mine!&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>With great pain and many delays Roland traversed
the field of slaughter, looking in the faces of the dead,
till he had found and brought to Turpin&rsquo;s feet the
bodies of the eleven Peers, last of all Oliver, his own
dear friend and brother, and Turpin blessed and absolved
them all. Now Roland&rsquo;s grief was so deep and his
weakness so great that he swooned where he stood,
and the archbishop saw him fall and heard his cry of
pain. Slowly and painfully Turpin struggled to his
feet, and, bending over Roland, took Olifant, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg&nbsp;151]</a></span>
curved ivory horn; inch by inch the dying archbishop
tottered towards a little mountain stream, that the few
drops he could carry might revive Roland.</p>


<h3>He Dies</h3>

<p>However, his weakness overcame him before he
reached the water, and he fell forward dying. Feebly
he made his confession, painfully he joined his hands
in prayer, and as he prayed his spirit fled. Turpin,
the faithful champion of the Cross, in teaching and in
battle, died in the service of Charlemagne. May God
have mercy on his soul!</p>

<p>When Roland awoke from his swoon he looked for
Turpin, and found him dead, and, seeing Olifant, he
guessed what the archbishop&rsquo;s aim had been, and wept
for pity. Crossing the fair white hands over Turpin&rsquo;s
breast, he sadly prayed:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Alas! brave priest, fair lord of noble birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy soul I give to the great King of Heaven!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No mightier champion has He in His hosts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No prophet greater to maintain the Faith,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No teacher mightier to convert mankind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since Christ&rsquo;s Apostles walked upon the earth!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May thy fair soul escape the pains of Hell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Paradise receive thee in its bowers!&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>


<h3>Roland&rsquo;s Last Fight</h3>

<p>Now death was very near to Roland, and he felt it
coming upon him while he yet prayed and commended
himself to his guardian angel Gabriel. Taking in one
hand Olifant, and in the other his good sword Durendala,
Roland climbed a little hill, one bowshot within the
realm of Spain. There under two pine-trees he found
four marble steps, and as he was about to climb them,
fell swooning on the grass very near his end. A lurking
Saracen, who had feigned death, stole from his covert,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg&nbsp;152]</a></span>
and, calling aloud, &ldquo;Charles&rsquo;s nephew is vanquished!
I will bear his sword back to Arabia,&rdquo; seized Durendala
as it lay in Roland&rsquo;s dying clasp. The attempt roused
Roland, and he opened his eyes, saying, &ldquo;Thou art not
of us,&rdquo; then struck such a blow with Olifant on the
helm of the heathen thief that he fell dead before his
intended victim.</p>


<h3>He Tries to Break his Sword</h3>

<p>Pale, bleeding, dying, Roland struggled to his feet,
bent on saving his good blade from the defilement of
heathen hands. He grasped Durendala, and the brown
marble before him split beneath his mighty blows; but
the good sword stood firm, the steel grated but did not
break, and Roland lamented aloud that his famous
sword must now become the weapon of a lesser man.
Again Roland smote with Durendala, and clove the
block of sardonyx, but the good steel only grated and
did not break, and the hero bewailed himself aloud,
saying, &ldquo;Alas! my good Durendala, how bright and
pure thou art! How thou flamest in the sunbeams,
as when the angel brought thee! How many lands
hast thou conquered for Charles my King, how many
champions slain, how many heathen converted!
Must I now leave thee to the pagans? May God
spare fair France this shame!&rdquo; A third time Roland
raised the sword and struck a rock of blue marble, which
split asunder, but the steel only grated&mdash;it would not
break; and the hero knew that he could do no more.</p>


<h3>His Last Prayer</h3>

<p>Then he flung himself on the ground under a pine-tree
with his face to the earth, his sword and Olifant
beneath him, his face to the foe, that Charlemagne and
the Franks might see when they came that he died
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg&nbsp;153]</a></span>
victorious. He made his confession, prayed for mercy,
and offered to Heaven his glove, in token of submission
for all his sins. &ldquo;<em>Mea culpa!</em> O God! I pray for
pardon for all my sins, both great and small, that I
have sinned from my birth until this day.&rdquo; So he held
up towards Heaven his right-hand glove, and the
angels of God descended around him. Again Roland
prayed:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;O very Father, who didst never lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Didst bring St. Lazarus from the dead again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Didst save St. Daniel from the lion&rsquo;s mouth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save Thou my soul and keep it from all ills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I have merited by all my sins!&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>


<h3>He Dies</h3>

<p>Again he held up to Heaven his glove, and St.
Gabriel received it; then, with head bowed and
hands clasped, the hero died, and the waiting cherubim,
St. Raphael, St. Michael, and St. Gabriel, bore his soul
to Paradise.</p>

<p>So died Roland and the Peers of France.</p>


<h3>Charles Arrives</h3>

<p>Soon after Roland&rsquo;s heroic spirit had passed away
the emperor came galloping out of the mountains into
the valley of Roncesvalles, where not a foot of ground
was without its burden of death.</p>

<p>Loudly he called: &ldquo;Fair nephew, where art thou?
Where is the archbishop? And Count Oliver?
Where are the Peers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alas! of what avail was it to call? No man replied,
for all were dead; and Charlemagne wrung his hands,
and tore his beard and wept, and his army bewailed
their slain comrades, and all men thought of vengeance.
Truly a fearful vengeance did Charles take, in that
terrible battle which he fought the next day against the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg&nbsp;154]</a></span>
Emir of Babylon, come from oversea to help his vassal
Marsile, when the sun stood still in heaven that the
Christians might be avenged on their enemies; in the
capture of Saragossa and the death of Marsile, who,
already mortally wounded, turned his face to the wall
and died when he heard of the defeat of the emir;
but when vengeance was taken on the open enemy
Charlemagne thought of mourning, and returned to
Roncesvalles to seek the body of his beloved nephew.</p>

<p>The emperor knew well that Roland would be found
before his men, with his face to the foe. Thus he
advanced a bowshot from his companions and climbed
a little hill, there found the little flowery meadow
stained red with the blood of his barons, and there at
the summit, under the trees, lay the body of Roland
on the green grass. The broken blocks of marble bore
traces of the hero&rsquo;s dying efforts, and Charlemagne
raised Roland, and, clasping the hero in his arms,
lamented over him.</p>


<h3>His Lament</h3>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;The Lord have mercy, Roland, on thy soul!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never again shall our fair France behold<br /></span>

</div>
</div>


<h3>The Dead Buried</h3>

<p>The French army buried the dead with all honour,
where they had fallen, except the bodies of Roland,
Oliver, and Turpin, which were carried to Blaye, and
interred in the great cathedral there; and then Charlemagne
returned to Aix.</p>


<h3>Aude the Fair</h3>

<p>As Charles the Great entered his palace a beauteous
maiden met him, Aude the Fair, the sister of Oliver and
betrothed bride of Roland. She asked eagerly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Roland the mighty captain, who swore to
take me for his bride?&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">Aude the Fair<br />
Evelyn Paul</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas! dear sister and friend,&rdquo; said Charlemagne,
weeping and tearing his long white beard, &ldquo;thou askest
tidings of the dead. But I will replace him: thou
shalt have Louis, my son, Count of the Marches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These words are strange,&rdquo; exclaimed Aude the
Fair. &ldquo;God and all His saints and angels forbid that
I should live when Roland my love is dead.&rdquo; Thereupon
she lost her colour and fell at the emperor&rsquo;s
feet; he thought her fainting, but she was dead. God
have mercy on her soul!</p>


<h3>The Traitor Put to Death</h3>

<p>Too long it would be to tell of the trial of Ganelon
the traitor. Suffice it that he was torn asunder by wild
horses, and his name remains in France a byword for
all disloyalty and treachery.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII: THE COUNTESS
CATHLEEN</h2>


<h3>Celtic Mysticism</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N all Celtic literature there is recognisable a certain
spirit which seems to be innate in the very character
of the people, a spirit of mysticism and
acknowledgment of the supernatural. It carries with
it a love of Nature, a delight in beauty, colour and
harmony, which is common to all the Celtic races. But
with these characteristics we find in Ireland a spiritual
beauty, a passion of self-sacrifice, unknown in Wales or
Brittany. Hence the early Irish heroes are frequently
found renouncing advantages, worldly honour, and life
itself, at the bidding of some imperative moral impulse.
They are the knights-errant of early European chivalry
which was a much deeper and more real inspiration
than the carefully cultivated artificial chivalry of centuries
later. Cuchulain, Diarmuit, Naesi all pay with
their lives for their obedience to the dictates of honour
and conscience. And in women, for whom in those
early days sacrifice of self was the only way of heroism,
the surrender even of eternal bliss was only the sublimation
of honour and chivalry; and this was the heroism
of the Countess Cathleen.</p>


<h3>The Cathleen Legend</h3>

<p>The legend is old, so old that its root has been lost
and we know not who first imagined it; but the idea,
the central incident, doubtless goes back to Druid
times, when a woman might well have offered herself
up to the cruel gods to avert their wrath and stay the
plagues which fell upon her people. Under a like impulse
Curtius sprang into the gulf in the Forum, and
Decius devoted himself to death to win the safety of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg&nbsp;157]</a></span>
the Roman army. In each case the powers, evil or
beneficent, were supposed to be appeased by the offering
of a human life. When Christianity found this
legend of sacrifice popular among the heathen nations,
it was comparatively easy to adopt it and give it a yet
wider scope, by making the sacrifice spiritual rather
than physical, and by finally rewarding the hero with
heavenly joys. It is to be noted, too, that even at this
early period there is a certain glorification of chicanery:
the fiend fulfils his side of the contract, but God Himself
breaks the other side. This becomes a regular
feature in all tales that relate dealings with the Evil
One: all Devil&rsquo;s Bridges, Devil&rsquo;s Dykes, and the
Faust legends show that Satan may be trusted to keep
his word, while the saints invariably kept the letter and
broke the spirit. To so primitive a tale as that of
&ldquo;The Countess Cathleen&rdquo; the pettifogging quibbles of
later saints are utterly unknown: God saves her soul
because it is His will to reward such abnegation of self,
and even the Evil One dare not question the Divine Will.</p>


<h3>The Story. Happy Ireland</h3>

<p>Once, long ago, as the Chronicles tell us, Ireland
was known throughout Europe as &ldquo;The Isle of Saints,&rdquo;
for St. Patrick had not long before preached the Gospel,
the message of good tidings, to the warring inhabitants,
to tribes of uncivilised Celts, and to marauding
Danes and Vikings. He had driven out the serpent-worshippers,
and consecrated the Black Stone of Tara
to the worship of the True God; he had convinced the
High King of the truth and reasonableness of the doctrine
of the Trinity by the illustration of the shamrock
leaf, and had overthrown the great idols and purified
the land. Therefore the fair shores and fertile vales of
Erin, the clustered islets, dropped like jewels in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg&nbsp;158]</a></span>
azure seas, the mist-covered, heather-clad hill-sides, even
the barren mountain-tops and the patches of firm
ground scattered in the solitudes of fathomless bogs,
were homes of pious Culdee or lonely hermit. There
was still strife in Ireland, for king fought with king, and
heathen marauders still vexed the land; but many warlike
Irish clans or &ldquo;septs&rdquo; turned their ardour for fight
to religious conflicts, and often every man of a tribe became
a monk, so that great abbeys and tribal monasteries
and schools were built on the hills where, in
former days, stood the chieftain&rsquo;s stronghold (<i>rath</i> or
<i>dun</i>, as Irish legends name it), with its earth mounds and
wooden palisades. Holy psalms and chants replaced
the boastful songs of the old bards, whilst warriors
accustomed to regard fighting and hunting as the only
occupations worthy of a free-born man, now peacefully
illuminated manuscripts or wrought at useful handicrafts.
Yet still in secret they dreaded and tried to
appease the wrath of the Dagda, Brigit of the Holy
Fire, &AElig;ngus the Ever-Young, and the awful Washers of
the Ford, the Choosers of the Slain; and to this dread
was now joined the new fear of the cruel demons who
obeyed Satan, the Prince of Evil.</p>


<h3>The Young Countess</h3>

<p>At this time there dwelt in Ireland the Countess
Cathleen, young, good, and beautiful. Her eyes were
as deep, as changeful, and as pure as the ocean that
washed Erin&rsquo;s shores; her yellow hair, braided in two
long tresses, was as bright as the golden circlet on her
brow or the yellow corn in her garners; and her step
was as light and proud and free as that of the deer in
her wide domains. She lived in a stately castle in the
midst of great forests, with the cottages of her tribesmen
around her gates, and day by day and year by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg&nbsp;159]</a></span>
year she watched the changing glories of the mighty
woods, as the seasons brought new beauties, till her
soul was as lovely as the green woods and purple
hills around. The Countess Cathleen loved the dim,
mysterious forest, she loved the tales of the ancient
gods, and of</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Old, unhappy, far-off things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And battles long ago;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="author">Wordsworth.</p>

<p>but more than all she loved her clansmen and vassals:
she prayed for them at all the holy hours, and taught
and tended them with loving care, so that in no place in
Ireland could be found a happier tribe than that which
obeyed her gentle rule.</p>


<h3>Dearth and Famine</h3>

<p>One year there fell upon Ireland, erewhile so happy,
a great desolation&mdash;&ldquo;For Scripture saith, an ending to
all good things must be&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>&mdash;and the happiness of the
Countess Cathleen&rsquo;s tribe came to an end in this wise:
A terrible famine fell on the land; the seed-corn rotted
in the ground, for rain and never-lifting mists filled
the heavy air and lay on the sodden earth; then when
spring came barren fields lay brown where the shooting
corn should be; the cattle died in the stall or fell from
weakness at the plough, and the sheep died of hunger
in the fold; as the year passed through summer
towards autumn the berries failed in the sun-parched
woods, and the withered leaves, fallen long before the
time, lay rotting on the dank earth; the timid wild
things of the forest, hares, rabbits, squirrels, died in
their holes or fell easy victims to the birds and beasts
of prey; and these, in their turn, died of hunger in the
famine-stricken forests.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg&nbsp;160]</a></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;I searched all day: the mice and rats and hedgehogs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed to be dead, and I could hardly hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wing moving in all the famished woods.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a><br /></span>
</div>
</div>


<h3>Distress of the Peasants</h3>

<p>A cry of bitter agony and lamentation rose from the
starving Isle of Saints to the gates of Heaven, and fell
back unheard; the sky was hard as brass above and
the earth was barren beneath, and men and women
died in despair, their shrivelled lips still stained green
by the dried grass and twigs they had striven to eat.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;I passed by Margaret Nolan&rsquo;s: for nine days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her mouth was green with dock and dandelion;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now they wake her.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>


<h3>The Misery Increases</h3>

<p>In vain the High King of Ireland proclaimed a
universal peace, and wars between quarrelling tribes
stopped and foreign pirates ceased to molest the land,
and chief met chief in the common bond of misery;
in vain the rich gave freely of their wealth&mdash;soon there
was no distinction between rich and poor, high and low,
chief and vassal, for all alike felt the grip of famine, all
died by the same terrible hunger. Soon many of the
great monasteries lay desolate, their stores exhausted,
their portals open, while the brethren, dead within, had
none to bury them; the lonely hermits died in their
little beehive-shaped cells, or fled from the dreadful
solitude to gather in some wealthy abbey which could
still feed its monks; and isle and vale which had
echoed their holy chants knew the sounds no more.
Over all, unlifting, unchanging, brooded the deadly
vapour, bearing the plague in its heavy folds, and
filling the air with a sultry lurid haze.</p>

<h3>Cathleen Heartbroken for her People</h3>

<p>Round the castle of the Countess Cathleen there was
great stir and bustle, for her tender heart was wrung
with the misery of her people, and her prayers for them
ascended to God unceasingly. So thin she grew and so
worn that the physicians bade her servants bring harp
and song to charm away the sadness that weighed upon
her spirit; but all in vain! Neither the well-loved
legends of the ancient gods, nor her harp, nor the voice
of her bards could bring her relief&mdash;nothing but the
attempt to save her people. From the earliest days of
the famine her house and her stores were ever ready to
supply the wants of the homeless, the poor, the suffering;
her wealth was freely spent for food for the
starving while supplies could yet be bought either near
or in distant baronies; and when known supplies failed
her lavish offers tempted the churlish farmers, who still
hoarded grain that they might enrich themselves in the
great dearth, to sell some of their garnered stores.
When she could no longer induce them to part with
their grain, her own winter provisions, wine and corn,
were distributed generously to all who asked for relief,
and none ever left her castle without succour.</p>


<h3>Her Wide Charity</h3>

<p>Thus passed the early months of bitter starvation,
and the Countess Cathleen&rsquo;s name was borne far and
wide through Ireland, accompanied with the blessings
of all the rescued; and round her castle, from every
district, gathered a mighty throng of poor&mdash;not only her
own clansmen&mdash;who all looked to her for a daily dole of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg&nbsp;162]</a></span>
food and drink to keep some life in them until the
pestilential mists should pass away. The wholesome
cold of winter would purify the air and bring new hope
and promise of new life in the coming year. Alas!
the winter drew on apace and still the poisonous
yellow vapours hung heavily over the land, and still the
deadly famine clutched each feeble heart and weakened
the very springs of life, and the winter frosts slew more
than the summer heats, so feeble were the people and so
weakened.</p>


<h3>Lawlessness Breaks Out</h3>

<p>At last, even in the Isle of Saints, the bonds of right
and wrong were loosened, all respect for property
vanished in the universal desolation, and men began to
rob and plunder, to trust only to the right of might,
thinking that their poor miserable lives were of more
value than aught else, than conscience and pity and
honesty. Thus Cathleen lost by barefaced robbery
much of what she still possessed of flocks and herds, of
scanty fruit and corn. Her servants would gladly have
pursued the robbers and regained the spoils, but Cathleen
forbade it, for she pitied the miserable thieves, and
thought no evil of them in this bitter dearth. By this
time she had distributed all her winter stores, and had
only enough to feed her poor pensioners and her household
with most scanty rations; and she herself shared
equally with them, for the most earnest entreaties of her
faithful servants could not induce her to fare better than
they in anything. Soon there would be nothing left for
daily distribution, and her heart almost broke as she saw
the misery of her helpless dependents; they looked to
her as an angel of pity and deliverance, while she knew
herself to be as helpless as they. Day by day Cathleen
went among them, with her pitifully scanty doles of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg&nbsp;163]</a></span>
food, cheering them by her words and smiles, and by
her very presence; and each day she went to her chapel,
where she could cast aside the mask of cheerfulness
she wore before her people, and prayed to the Blessed
Virgin Mary and all the saints to show her how to save
her own tribe and all the land.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 411px;">
<img src="images/hmlbr23.jpg" width="411" height="600" alt="" />
<a name="image_page_162" id="image_page_162"></a>
</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;Day by day Cathleen went among them&rdquo;</p>


<h3>Cathleen Has an Inspiration</h3>

<p>As the Countess knelt long before the altar one noontide
she passed from her prayers into a deep sleep, and
sank down on the altar steps. In the troubled depths
of her mind a thought arose, which came to her as an
inspiration from Heaven itself. She awoke and sprang
up joyfully, exclaiming aloud: &ldquo;Thanks be to Our Lady
and to all the saints! To them alone the blessed
thought is due. Thus can I save my poor until the
dearth is over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Cathleen left her oratory with such a light
heart as she had not felt since the terrible visitation
began, and the gladness in her face was so new and
wonderful that all her servants noticed the change, and
her old foster-mother, who loved the Countess with the
utmost devotion, shuddered at the thought that perhaps
her darling had come under the power of the ancient
gods and would be bewitched away to Tir-nan-og,
the land of never-dying youth. Fearfully old Oona
watched Cathleen&rsquo;s face as she passed through the hall,
and Cathleen saw the anxious gaze, and came and laid
her hand on the old woman&rsquo;s shoulder, saying, &ldquo;Nay,
fear not, nurse; the saints have heard my prayer and
put it into my heart to save all these helpless ones.&rdquo;
Then she crossed the hall to her own room, and called
a servant, saying, &ldquo;Send hither quickly Fergus my
steward.&rdquo;</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg&nbsp;164]</a></span></p>

<h3>She Summons her Steward</h3>

<p>Shortly afterwards the steward came, Fergus the
White, an old grey-haired man, who had been foster-brother
to Cathleen&rsquo;s grandfather. He had seen three
generations pass away, he had watched the change from
heathenism to Christianity, and of all the chief&rsquo;s family,
to which his loyal devotion had ever clung, there remained
but this one young girl, and he loved her as
his own child. Fergus did obeisance to his liege lady,
and kissed her hand kneeling as he asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would the Countess Cathleen with her
steward? Shall I render my account of lands and
wealth?&rdquo;</p>


<h3>Demands to Know what Wealth she Owns</h3>

<p>&ldquo;How much have I in lands?&rdquo; the Countess asked.
And Fergus answered in surprise: &ldquo;Your lands are
worth one hundred thousand pounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of what value is the timber in my forests?&rdquo; &ldquo;As
much again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the worth of my castles and my fair
residences?&rdquo; continued the Countess Cathleen. And
Fergus still replied: &ldquo;As much more,&rdquo; though in his
heart he questioned why his lady wished to know now,
while the famine made all riches seem valueless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much gold still unspent lies in thy charge in
my treasure-chests?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lady, your stored gold is three hundred thousand
pounds, as much as all your lands and forests and
houses are worth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Countess Cathleen thought for an instant, and
then, as one who makes a momentous decision, spoke
firmly, though her lips quivered as she gave utterance
to her thought:</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg&nbsp;165]</a></span></p>

<h3>&ldquo;Go Far and Buy Food&rdquo;</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Then, Fergus, take my bags of coin and go. Leave
here my jewels and some gold, for I may hear of some
stores of grain hoarded by niggard farmers, and may
induce them to sell, if not for the love of God, then
for the love of gold. Take, too, authority from me,
written and sealed with my seal, to sell all my lands and
timber, and castles, except this one alone where I must
dwell. Send a man, trustworthy and speedy, to the
North, to Ulster, where I hear the famine is less terrible,
and let him buy what cattle he can find, and drive them
back as soon as may be.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Keeping this house alone, sell all I have;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go to some distant country, and come again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With many herds of cows and ships of grain.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>


<h3>The Steward Reluctantly Obeys</h3>

<p>The ancient steward, Fergus the White, stood at first
speechless with horror and grief, but after a moment of
silence his sorrow found vent in words, and he besought
his dear lady not to sell everything, her ancient home,
her father&rsquo;s lands, her treasured heirlooms, and leave
herself no wealth for happier times. All his persuasions
were useless, for Cathleen would not be moved; she
bade him &ldquo;Farewell&rdquo; and hastened his journey, saying,
&ldquo;A cry is in mine ears; I cannot rest.&rdquo; So there was
no help for it. A trusty man was despatched to Ulster
to buy up all the cattle (weak and famine-stricken as
they would be) in the North Country; while Fergus
himself journeyed swiftly to England, which was still
prosperous and fertile, untouched by the deadly famine,
and knowing nothing of the desolation of the sister isle,
to which the English owed so much of their knowledge
of the True Faith.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg&nbsp;166]</a></span></p>

<h3>Buys Stores in England</h3>

<p>In England Fergus spent all the gold he brought
with him, and then sold all the Countess Cathleen bade
him sell&mdash;lands, castles, forests, pastures, timber&mdash;all
but one lonely castle in the desolate woods, where she
dwelt among her own people, with the dying folk
thronging round her gates and in her halls. Good
bargains Fergus made also, for he was a shrewd and
loyal steward, and the saints must have touched the
hearts of the English merchants, so that they gave
good prices for all, or perhaps they did not realize the
dire distress that prevailed in Ireland. However that
may have been, Fergus prospered in his trading, and
bought grain, and wine, and fat oxen and sheep, so that
he loaded many ships with full freights of provisions,
enough to carry the starving peasantry through the
famine year till the next harvest. At last all his money
was spent, all his ships were laden, everything was
ready, and the little fleet lay in harbour, only awaiting
a fair wind, which, unhappily, did not come.</p>


<h3>His Return Delayed</h3>

<p>First of all Fergus waited through a deadly calm,
when the sails hung motionless, drooping, with no
breath of air to stir them, when the fog that brooded
over the shores of England never lifted and all sailing
was impossible; then the winds dispersed the fog,
and Fergus, forgetting caution in his great anxiety to
return, hastily set sail for his own land, and there came
fierce tempests and contrary winds, so that his little
fleet was driven back, and one or two ships went down
with all their stores of food. Fergus wept to see his
lady&rsquo;s wealth lost in the wintry sea, but he dared not
venture again, and though he chafed and fretted at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg&nbsp;167]</a></span>
the delay, it was nearly two months after he reached
England before he could sail back to his young mistress
and her starving countrymen. The trusty messenger
who had been sent to buy cattle had succeeded beyond
his own expectation; he also had made successful
bargains, and had found more cattle than he believed
were still alive in Ireland. He had bought all, and was
driving them slowly towards the Countess Cathleen&rsquo;s
forest dwelling. Their progress was so slow, because of
their weakness and the scanty fodder by the way, that
no news of them came to Cathleen, and she knew not
that while corn and cattle were coming with Fergus
across the sea, food was also coming to her slowly
through the barren ways of her own native land. None
of this she knew, and despair would have filled her
heart, but for her faith in God and her belief in the
great inspiration that had been given to her.</p>


<h3>Deepening Misery in Ireland</h3>

<p>Meanwhile terrible things had been happening in
Ireland. As in England in later days, &ldquo;men said openly
that Christ and His saints slept&rdquo;; they thought with
longing of the mighty old gods, for the new seemed
powerless, and they yearned for the friendly &ldquo;good
people&rdquo; who had fled from the sound of the church
bell. Thus many minds were ready to revolt from the
Christian faith if they had not feared the life after death
and the endless torments of the Christian Hell. Some
few, desperate, even offered secret worship to the old
heathen gods, and true love to the One True God had
grown cold.</p>


<h3>Two Mysterious Strangers</h3>

<p>Now on the very day on which Fergus sailed for England,
and his comrade departed to Ulster, two mysterious
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg&nbsp;168]</a></span>
and stately strangers suddenly appeared in Erin. Whence
they came no man knew, but they were first seen near
the wild sea-shore of the west, and the few poor inhabitants
thought they had been put ashore by some
vessel or wrecked on that dangerous coast. Aliens they
certainly were, for they talked with each other in a
tongue that none understood, and they appeared as if
they did not comprehend the questions asked of them.
Thus they passed away from the western coasts, and
made their way inland; but when they next appeared,
in a village not far from Dublin, they had greatly
changed: they wore magnificent robes and furs, with
splendid jewelled gloves on their hands, and golden
circlets, set with gleaming rubies, bound their brows;
their black steeds showed no trace of weakness and
famine as they rode through the woods and carefully
noted the misery everywhere.</p>


<h3>Their Strange Story</h3>

<p>At last they alighted at the little lodge, where a
forester&rsquo;s widow gladly received them; and their royal
dress, lofty bearing and strange language accorded ill
with the mean surroundings and the scanty accommodation
of that little hut. The dead forester had
been one of the Countess Cathleen&rsquo;s most faithful
vassals, and his holding was but a short distance from
the castle, so that the strangers could, unobserved, watch
the life of the little village. As time passed they told
their hostess they were merchants, simple traders from a
distant country, trafficking in very precious gems; but
they had no wares for exchange, and no gems to show;
they made no inquiries or researches, bargained with
no man, seemed to do no business; they were the most
unusual merchants ever seen in Ireland, and the strangeness
of their behaviour troubled men&rsquo;s minds.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg&nbsp;169]</a></span></p>

<h3>Mysterious Behaviour</h3>

<p>Day by day they ate, unquestioning, the coarse food
their poor hostess set before them, and the black bread
which was the best food obtainable in those terrible
days, but they added to it wine, rich and red, from
their own private store, and they paid her lavishly in
good red gold, so that she wondered that any men
should stay in the famine-stricken country when they
could so easily leave it at their will. Gradually, too,
speaking now in the Irish tongue, they began to ask
her cautious questions of the people, of the land, of
the famine, how men lived and how they died, and so
they heard of the exceeding goodness of the Countess
Cathleen, whose bounty had saved so many lives, and
was still saving others, though the deadly pinch of famine
grew sorer with the passing days. To their hostess they
admired Cathleen&rsquo;s goodness, and were loud in her
praises, but they looked askance at one another and
their brows were black with discontent.</p>


<h3>Professed Errand of Mercy</h3>

<p>Then one day the kingly merchants told the poor
widow who harboured them that they too were the
friends of the poor and starving; they were servants
of a mighty prince, who in his compassion and mercy
had sent them on a mission to Ireland to help the
afflicted peasants to fight against famine and death.
They said that they themselves had no food to give,
only wine and gold in plenty, so that men might exert
themselves and search for food to buy. Their hostess,
hearing this, and knowing that there were still some
niggards who refused to part with their mouldering
heaps of corn, setting the price so high that no man
could buy, called down the blessing of God and Mary
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg&nbsp;170]</a></span>
and all the saints upon their heads, for if they would
distribute their gold to all, or even buy the corn themselves
and distribute it, men need no longer die of
hunger.</p>


<h3>A New Traffic</h3>

<p>When she prayed for a blessing on the two strangers
they smiled scornfully and impatiently; and the elder
said, cunningly:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Alas! we know the evils of mere charity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And would devise a more considered way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let each man bring one piece of merchandise.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, sirs!&rdquo; replied the hostess, &ldquo;then your compassion,
your gold and your goodwill are of no avail.
Think you, after all these weary months, that any man
has merchandise left to sell? They have sold long ago
all but the very clothes they wear, to keep themselves
alive till better days come. Such offers are mockery of
our distress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We mock you not,&rdquo; said the elder merchant. &ldquo;All
men have the one precious thing we wish to buy, and
have come hither to find; none has already lost or
sold it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What precious treasure can you mean? Men in
Ireland now have only their lives, and can barely
cherish those,&rdquo; said the poor woman, wondering greatly
and much afraid.</p>


<h3>Buyers of Souls</h3>

<p>The elder merchant continued gazing at her with a
crafty smile and an eye ever on the alert for tokens of
understanding. &ldquo;Poor as they are, Irishmen have still
one thing that we will purchase, if they will sell: their
souls, which we have come to obtain for our mighty
Prince, and with the great price that we shall pay in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg&nbsp;171]</a></span>
pure gold men can well save their lives till the starving
time is over. Why should men die a cruel, lingering
death or drag through weary months of miserable half-satisfied
life when they may live well and merrily at
the cost of a soul, which is no good but to cause fear
and pain? We take men&rsquo;s souls and liberate them from
all pain and care and remorse, and we give in exchange
money, much money, to procure comforts and ease;
we enrol men as vassals of our great lord, and he is no
hard taskmaster to those who own his sway.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>Slow Trade at First</h3>

<p>When the poor widow heard these dreadful words
she knew that the strangers were demons come to
tempt men&rsquo;s souls and to lure them to Hell. She
crossed herself, and fled from them in fear, praying to
be kept from temptation; and she would not return to
her little cottage in the forest, but stayed in the village
warning men against the evil demons who were tempting
the starving people, till she too died of the famine,
and her house was left wholly to the strangers. Yet
the merchants fared ever well, better than before her
departure, and those who ventured to the forest
dwelling found good food and rich wine, which the
strangers sometimes gave to their visitors, with crafty
hints of abundance to be easily obtained. Then when
timid individuals asked the way to win these comforts
the strangers began their tempting, and represented the
case to be gained by the sale of men&rsquo;s souls. One man,
bolder than the rest, made a bargain with the demons
and gave them his soul for three hundred crowns of
gold, and from that time he in his turn became a
tempter. He boasted of his wealth, of the rich food
the merchants gave him at times, of the potent wine
he drank from their generously opened bottles, and,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg&nbsp;172]</a></span>
best of all, he vaunted his freedom from pity, conscience,
or remorse.</p>


<h3>Trade Increases</h3>

<p>Gradually many people came to the forest dwelling
and trafficked with the demon merchants. The purchase
of souls went on busily, and the demons paid prices
varying according to the worth of the soul and the
record of its former sins; but to all who sold they
gave food and wine, and in gloating over their gold
and satisfying hunger and thirst, men forgot to ask
whence came this food and wine and the endless stores
of coin. Now many people ventured into the forest to
deal with the demons, and the narrow track grew into
a broad beaten way with the numbers of those who
came, and all returned fed and warmed, and bearing
bags heavy with coin, and the promise of abundant
food and easy service. Those who had sold their souls
rioted with the money, for the demons gave them food,
and they bought wine from the inexhaustible stores
of the evil merchants. The poor, lost people knew that
there was no hope for them after death, and they tried
by all means to keep themselves alive and to enjoy
what was yet left to them; but their mirth was fearful
and they durst not stop to think.</p>


<h3>Cathleen Hears of the Demon Traders</h3>

<p>At first the Countess Cathleen knew nothing of the
terrible doings of the demons, for she never passed beyond
her castle gates, but spent her time in prayer for
her people&rsquo;s safety and for the speedy return of her messengers;
but when the starving throng of pensioners at
her gates grew daily less, and there were fewer claimants
for the pitiful allowance which was all she had to give,
she wondered if some other mightier helper had come
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg&nbsp;173]</a></span>
to Ireland. But she could hear of none, and soon the
shameless rioting and drunkenness in the village came
to her knowledge, and she wondered yet more whence
her clansmen obtained the means for their excesses, for
she felt instinctively that the origin of all this rioting
must be evil. Cathleen therefore called to her an old
peasant, whose wife had died of hunger in the early
days of the famine, so that he himself had longed to
die and join her; but when he came to her she was
horror-struck by the change in him. Now he came
flushed with wine, with defiant look and insolent bearing,
and his face was full of evil mirth as he tried to
answer soberly the Countess&rsquo;s questions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do the villagers and strangers no longer
come to me for food? I have but little now to give,
but all are welcome to share it with me and my
household.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The Peasant&rsquo;s Story</h3>

<p>&ldquo;They do not come, O Countess, because they are
no longer starving. They have better food and wine,
and abundance of money to buy more.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 410px;">
<img src="images/hmlbr24.jpg" width="410" height="600" alt="" />
<a name="image_page_172" id="image_page_172"></a>
</div>

<p class="caption">The peasant&rsquo;s story</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whence then have they obtained the money, the
food, and the wine for the drinking-bouts, the tumult
of which reaches me even in my oratory?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lady, they have received all from the generous
merchants who are in the forest dwelling where old
Mairi formerly lived; she is dead now, and these noble
strangers keep open house in her cottage night and
day; they are so wealthy that they need not stint their
bounty, and so powerful that they can find good food,
enough for all who go to them. Since Brigit died
(your old servant, lady) her husband and son work no
more, but serve the strange merchants, and urge
men to join them; and I, and many others, have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg&nbsp;174]</a></span>
done so, and we are now wealthy&rdquo; (here he showed
the Countess a handful of gold) &ldquo;and well fed, and have
wine as much as heart can desire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But do you give them nothing in return for all
their generosity? Are they so noble that they ask
nothing in requital of their bounty?&rdquo;</p>


<h3>&ldquo;Good Gold for Souls&rdquo;</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, we give them something, but nothing
of importance, nothing we cannot spare. They are
merchants of souls, and buy them for their king, and
they pay good red gold for the useless, painful things.
I have sold my soul to them, and now I weep no more
for my wife; I am gay, and have wine enough and
gold enough to help me through this dearth!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; sighed the Countess, &ldquo;and what when
you too die?&rdquo; The old peasant laughed at her grief
as he said: &ldquo;Then, as now, I shall have no soul to
trouble me with remorse or conscience&rdquo;; and the
Countess covered her eyes with her hand and beckoned
silently that he should go. In her oratory, whither she
betook herself immediately, she prayed with all her
spirit that the Virgin and all the saints would inspire
her to defeat the demons and to save her people&rsquo;s souls.</p>


<h3>Cathleen Tries to Check the Traffic</h3>

<p>Next day Cathleen called together all the people in
the village, her own tribesmen and strangers. She
offered them again a share of all she had, and the daily
rations she could distribute, but told them that all must
share alike and that she had nothing but the barest
necessaries to give&mdash;scanty portions of corn and meal,
with milk from one or two famine-stricken cows her
servants had managed to keep alive. To this she
added that she had sent two trusty messengers for help,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg&nbsp;175]</a></span>
one to Ulster for cattle, and Fergus to England for
corn and wine; they must return soon, she felt sure,
with abundant supplies, if men would patiently await
their return.</p>


<h3>In Vain</h3>

<p>But all was useless. Her messengers had sent no
word of their return, and the abundant supplies at the
forest cottage were more easily obtained, and were less
carefully regulated, than those of the Countess Cathleen.
The merchants, too, were ever at hand with their cunning
wiles, and their active, persuasive dupes, who
would gladly bring all others into their own soulless
condition. The wine given by the demons warmed the
hearts of all who drank, and the deceived peasants
dreamed of happiness when the famine was over, and
so the passionate appeal of the Countess failed, and
the sale of souls continued merrily. The noise of
revelry grew daily louder and more riotous, and the
drinkers cared nothing for the death or departure of
their dearest friends; while those who died, died
drunken and utterly reckless, or full of horror and
despair, reviling the crafty merchants who had deceived
them with promises of life and happiness. The evil
influence clung all about the country-side, and seemed
in league with the pitiless powers of Nature against
the souls of men, till at last the stricken Countess,
putting her trust in God, sought out the forest lodge
where the demon merchants dwelt, trafficking for souls.
The way was easy to find now, for a broad beaten track
led to the dwelling, and as the evil spirits saw Cathleen
coming slowly along the path their wicked eyes gleamed
and their clawlike hands worked convulsively in their
jewelled gloves, for they hoped she had come to sell
her pure soul.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg&nbsp;176]</a></span></p>

<h3>She Visits the Demons</h3>

<p>&ldquo;What does the Countess Cathleen wish to obtain
from two poor stranger merchants?&rdquo; said the elder
with an evil smile; and the younger, bowing deeply
said: &ldquo;Lady, you may command us in all things, save
what touches our allegiance to our king.&rdquo; Cathleen
replied: &ldquo;I have no merchandise to barter, nothing for
trade with you, for you buy such things as I will never
sell: you buy men&rsquo;s souls for Hell. I come only to
beg that you will release the poor souls whom you have
bought for Satan&rsquo;s kingdom, and will have mercy on my
ignorant people and deceive them no more. I have yet
some gold unspent and jewels unsold: take all there is
but let my people go free.&rdquo; Then the merchants
laughed aloud scornfully, and rejected her offer.
&ldquo;Would you have us undo our work? Have we
toiled, then, for naught to extend our master&rsquo;s sway?
Have we won for him so many souls to dwell for ever
in his kingdom and do his work, and shall we give
them back for your entreaties? We have gold enough,
and food and wine enough, fair lady. The souls we
have bought we keep, for our master gives us honour
and rank proportioned to the number of souls we win
for him, and you may see by the golden circlets round
our brows that we are princes of his kingdom, and have
brought him countless souls. Nevertheless, there is
one most rare and precious thing which could redeem
these bartered souls of Ireland&rsquo;s peasants, things of little
worth.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>They Make a Proposal</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, what is that?&rdquo; said the Countess. &ldquo;If I have
it, or can in any way procure it, tell me, that I may
redeem these deluded people&rsquo;s souls.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg&nbsp;177]</a></span>
&ldquo;You have it now, fair saint. It is one pure soul,
precious as multitudes of more sin-stained souls. Our
master would far rather have a perfect and flawless pearl
for his diadem than myriads of these cracked and flawed
crystals. Your soul, most saintly Countess, would
redeem the souls of all your tribe, if you would sell it
to our king; it would be the fairest jewel in his crown.
But think not to save your people otherwise, and
beguile them no longer with false promises of help:
your messenger to Ulster lies sick of ague in the Bog of
Allen, and no food comes from England.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>False Tidings</h3>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i11">&ldquo;We saw a man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heavy with sickness in the Bog of Allen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom you had bid buy cattle. Near Fair Head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We saw your grain ships lying all becalmed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the dark night, and not less still than they<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burned all their mirrored lanterns in the sea.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>When Cathleen heard of the failure of her messengers
to bring food it seemed as if all hope were indeed over,
and the demons smiled craftily upon her as she turned
silently to go, and laughed joyously to each other when
she had left their presence. Now they had good hope
to win her for their master; but they knew that their
time was short, since help was not far away.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Last night, closed in the image of an owl,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I hurried to the cliffs of Donegal,<br /></span>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg&nbsp;178]</a></span></p>

<h3>Cathleen&rsquo;s Despair</h3>

<p>The Countess then went back in bitter grief to her
desolate castle, where only faithful old servants now
waited in the halls, and whispered together in the dark
corners, and, kneeling in her oratory, she prayed far into
the night for light in her darkness. As she prayed
before the altar she slept for very weariness, and was
aroused by a sudden furious knocking, and an outcry of
&ldquo;Thieves! Thieves!&rdquo; Cathleen rose quickly from
the altar steps, and met her foster-mother, Oona, at the
door of the oratory; and Oona cried aloud: &ldquo;Thieves
have broken into the treasure-chamber, and nothing is
left!&rdquo; Cathleen asked if this were true, and discovered
that not a single coin, not a single gem was left: the
demons had stolen all. And while the servants still
mourned over the lost treasures of the house there
came another cry of &ldquo;Thieves! Thieves!&rdquo; and an
old peasant rushed in, exclaiming that all the food was
gone. That, alas! was true: the few sacks of meal
which supplied the scanty daily fare were emptied and
the bags flung on the floor. Now indeed the last poor
resource was gone.</p>

<a name="image_page_176" id="image_page_176"></a>
</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;Thieves have broken into the treasure-chamber&rdquo;</p>


<h3>A Desperate Decision</h3>

<p>When the Countess heard of this last terrible
misfortune a great light broke upon her mind with a
blinding flash, and showed her a way to save others,
even at the cost of her own salvation. It seemed God&rsquo;s
answer to her prayer for guidance, and she resolved
to follow the inspiration thus sent into her mind.
She decided now what she would do; her mind was
made up, and the light which shines from extreme
sacrifice of self was so bright upon her face that her
old nurse and her servants, wailing around her, were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg&nbsp;179]</a></span>
awe-stricken and durst not question or check her.
She returned to her oratory door, and, standing on
the steps, looking down on her weeping domestics,
she cried:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i11">&ldquo;I am desolate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a most sad resolve wakes in my heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But always I have faith. Old men and women,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be silent; God does not forsake the world.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Mary Queen of Angels<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all you clouds and clouds of saints, farewell!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>With one last long gaze at the little altar of her oratory
she resolutely closed the door and turned away.</p>


<h3>She Revisits the Demons</h3>

<p>The next day the merchants in their forest lodge
were still buying souls, and giving food and wine to the
starving peasants who sold. They were buying men
and women, sinful, terrified, afraid to die, eager to live;
buying them more cheaply than before because of the
increase of sin and terror. Bargains were being struck
and bartering was in full progress, when suddenly all
the peasants stopped, shamefaced, as one said, &ldquo;Here
comes the Countess Cathleen,&rdquo; and down the track she
was seen approaching slowly. One by one the peasants
slunk away, and the demon merchants were quite alone
when Cathleen entered the little cottage where they sat,
with bags of coin on the table before them and on the
ground beside them. Again they greeted her with
mocking respect, and asked to know her will.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Merchants, do you still buy souls for Hell?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lady, our traffic prospers, for the famine lies long
on the land, and men would fain live till better days
come again. Besides, we can give them food and wine
and wealth for future years; and all in exchange for a
mere soul, a little breath of wind.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg&nbsp;180]</a></span>
&ldquo;Perhaps the Countess Cathleen has come to deal
with us,&rdquo; said the younger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Merchant, you are right; I have come to bring
you merchandise. I have a soul to sell, so costly that
perhaps the price is beyond your means.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The elder merchant replied joyfully: &ldquo;No price is
beyond our means, if only the soul be worth the price;
if it be a pure and stainless soul, fit to join the angels
and saints in Paradise, our master will gladly pay all
you ask. Whose is the soul, and what is the price?&rdquo;</p>


<h3>Her Terms</h3>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The people starve, therefore the people go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thronging to you. I hear a cry come from them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it is in my ears by night and day:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I would have five hundred thousand crowns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To find food for them till the dearth go by;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And have the wretched spirits you have bought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For your gold crowns, released, and sent to God.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The soul that I would barter is my soul.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>


<h3>The Bond Signed</h3>

<p>When the demons heard this, and knew that Cathleen
was willing to give her own soul as ransom for the
souls of others, they were overjoyed, their eyes flashed,
the rubies of their golden crowns shot out fiery gleams,
and their fingers clutched the air as if they already held
her stainless soul. This would be a great triumph to
their master, and they would win great honour in Hell
when they brought him a soul worth far, far more than
large abundance of ordinary sinful souls. Very carefully
they watched while the trembling Countess signed
the bond which gave her soul to Hell, very gladly they
paid down the money for which she had stipulated, and
very joyously they saw the signs of speedy death in her
face, knowing, as they did, how soon the coming relief
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg&nbsp;181]</a></span>
would show her sacrifice to have been unnecessary,
though now it was irrevocable.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 412px;">
<img src="images/hmlbr26.jpg" width="412" height="600" alt="" />
<a name="image_page_180" id="image_page_180"></a>
</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;Cathleen signed the bond&rdquo;</p>


<h3>General Lamentation</h3>

<p>Sadly but resolutely she turned away, followed by
her servants bearing the bags of gold, and as she passed
through the village a rumour ran before her of what
she had done. All men were sobered by the terrible
tidings, and the redeemed people waited for her coming,
and followed her weeping and lamenting, for now their
souls were free again, and they recognised the great
sacrifice she had made for them; but it was too late to
save her, though now all would have died for her.
Cathleen passed on into her castle, and there in the
courtyard she distributed the money to all her people,
and bade them dwell quietly in obedience till her steward
returned. She herself, she said, could not stay; she
must go on a long and dark journey, for her people&rsquo;s
need had broken her heart and conquered her; she
was no longer her own, but belonged to the dark lord
of Hell; she could not bid them pray for her, nor
could she pray for herself.</p>


<h3>Cathleen Fades Away</h3>

<p>Her people, who knew the great price at which she
had redeemed them, besought the Blessed Virgin and
all the saints to have mercy on her; and all the souls
she had released, on earth and in Heaven, prayed for
her night and day, and the blessed saints interceded
for her. Yet from day to day the Countess Cathleen
faded, and the demons, ceasing all other traffic, lurked
in waiting to catch her soul as she died. Night and day
her heart-broken foster-mother Oona tended her; but
she grew feebler, till it seemed that she would die before
Fergus returned.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg&nbsp;182]</a></span></p>

<h3>The Steward Returns</h3>

<p>On the fifth day, however, glad tidings came. Fergus
had landed, and sent word that he was bringing corn
and meal as quickly as possible; also a wandering
peasant brought a message that nine hundred oxen were
within one day&rsquo;s journey of her castle; and when the
gentle Cathleen heard this, and knew that her people
were safe, she died with a smile on her lips and thanks
to God for her people on her tongue. That same night
a great tempest broke over the land, which drove away
the pestilential mists, and left the country free from
evil influences, for with the morning men found the
forest lodge crushed beneath the fallen trees, and the
two demon merchants vanished. All gathered round
the castle and mourned for the Countess Cathleen, for
none knew how it would go with her spirit; they feared
that the evil demons had borne her soul to Hell. All
had prayed for her, but there had been no sign, no token
of forgiveness. Nevertheless their prayers were heard
and answered.</p>


<h3>The Demons Cheated</h3>

<p>In the next night, when the great storm had passed
away and the vapours no longer filled the air, when Fergus
had distributed food and wine, and the oxen had been
apportioned to every family, so that plenty reigned in
every house, when only Cathleen&rsquo;s castle lay desolate,
shrouded in gloom, the faithful old nurse Oona, watching
by the body of her darling, had a glorious vision.
She saw the splendid armies of the angels who guard
mankind from evil, she saw the saints who had suffered
and overcome, and amid them was the Countess Cathleen,
happy with saints and angels in the bliss of Paradise;
for her love had redeemed her own soul as well as the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg&nbsp;183]</a></span>
souls of others, and God had pardoned her sin because
of her self-sacrifice.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The light beats down: the gates of pearl are wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she is passing to the floor of peace,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Has kissed her lips, and the long blessed hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has fallen on her face; the Light of Lights<br /></span>

<h2>CHAPTER IX: CUCHULAIN, THE
CHAMPION OF IRELAND</h2>


<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>MONG all the early literatures of Europe, there
are two which, at exactly opposite corners of the
continent, display most strikingly similar characteristics,
characteristics which apparently point to some
racial affinity in the peoples who produced them. These
literatures are the Greek and the Irish. It has been
maintained with much ingenuity that the Greeks of
Homer, the early Britons, and the Irish Celts were all
of one stock, as shown by the many points they had in
common. It is certain that in customs, manner of life,
ethics, ideas of religion, and methods of warfare a
striking similarity may be seen between the Greeks as
described by Homer and the Britons as Julius C&aelig;sar
knew them, or the Irish as their own legends reveal
them. We must expect to find in their myths and legends
a certain resemblance of Celtic ideas to Greek ideas;
and if the great Achilles sulks in his tent because he is
unjustly deprived of his captive, the fair Briseis, we shall
not be surprised to find the Champion of Erin quarrelling
over his claim to precedence. The contest between
the heroes for the armour of dead Achilles is paralleled
by this contest between the three greatest warriors of
Ireland for the special dish of honour called the
&ldquo;Champion&rsquo;s Portion,&rdquo; a distinction which also recalls
Greek life.</p>


<h3>Cuchulain, the Irish Achilles</h3>

<p>The resemblance of the Cuchulain legend to the story
of Achilles is so strong that Cuchulain is often called
&ldquo;the Irish Achilles,&rdquo; but there are elements of humour
and pathos in his story which the tale of Achilles cannot
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg&nbsp;185]</a></span>
show, and in reckless courage, power of inspiring dread,
sense of personal merit, and frankness of speech the
Irish hero is not inferior to the mighty Greek. The
way in which Cuchulain established his claim to be
regarded as Chief Champion of Erin is related in the
following story, which shows some primitive Celtic
features found again in Welsh legends and other
national folk-tales.</p>


<h3>The Youth of Cuchulain</h3>

<p>Cuchulain was the nephew of King Conor of Ulster,
son of his sister Dechtire, and men say his father was
no mortal man, but the great god Lugh of the Long
Hand. When Cuchulain was born he was brought up
by King Conor himself and the wisest men of Ireland;
when five years old, he beat all the other boys in games
and warlike exercises, and on the day on which he was
seven he assumed the arms of a warrior, so much
greater was he than the sons of mortal men. Cuchulain
had overheard his tutor, Cathbad the Druid, say to the
older youths, &ldquo;If any young man take arms to-day, his
name will be greater than any other name in Ireland,
but his span of life will be short,&rdquo; and as he loved fame
above long life, he persuaded his uncle, King Conor, to
invest him with the weapons of manhood. His fame
soon spread all over Ireland, for his warlike deeds were
those of a proved warrior, not of a child of nursery age,
and by the time Cuchulain was seventeen he was in reality
without peer among the champions of Ulster, or of all
Ireland.</p>


<h3>Cuchulain&rsquo;s Marriage</h3>

<p>When the men of Ulster remembered Cuchulain&rsquo;s
divine origin, they would fain have him married, so that
he might not die childless; and for a year they searched
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg&nbsp;186]</a></span>
all Erin for a fit bride for so great a champion.
Cuchulain, however, went wooing for himself, to the
dun of Forgall the Wily, a Druid of great power.
Forgall had two daughters, of whom the younger, Emer,
was the most lovely and virtuous maiden to be found
in the country, and she became Cuchulain&rsquo;s chosen
bride. Gallant was his wooing, and merry and jesting
were her answers to his suit, for though Emer loved
Cuchulain at first sight she would not accept him at
once, and long they talked together. Finally Emer
consented to wed Cuchulain when he had undergone
certain trials and adventures for a year, and had accomplished
certain feats, a test which she imposed on her
lover, partly as a trial of his worthiness and constancy
and partly to satisfy her father Forgall, who would not
agree to the marriage. When Cuchulain returned
triumphant at the end of the year, he rescued Emer
from the confinement in which her father had placed
her, and won her at the sword&rsquo;s point; they were
wedded, and dwelt at Armagh, the capital of Ulster,
under the protection of King Conor.</p>


<h3>Bricriu&rsquo;s Feast</h3>

<p>It happened that at Conor&rsquo;s court was one chief who
delighted in making mischief, as Thersites among the
Grecian leaders. This man, Bricriu of the Bitter
Tongue, came to King Conor and invited him and all
the heroes of the Red Branch, the royal bodyguard of
Ulster, to a feast at his new dwelling, for he felt sure
he could find some occasion to stir up strife at a feast.
King Conor, however, and the Red Branch heroes, distrusted
Bricriu so much that they refused to accept
the invitation, unless Bricriu would give sureties that,
having received his guests, he would leave the hall
before the feasting began. Bricriu, who had expected
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg&nbsp;187]</a></span>
some such condition, readily agreed, and before going
home to prepare his feast took measures for stirring up
strife among the heroes of Ulster.</p>


<h3>Bricriu&rsquo;s Falsehood</h3>

<p>Before Bricriu left Armagh he went to the mighty
Laegaire and with many words of praise said: &ldquo;All
good be with you, O Laegaire, winner of battles!
Why should you not be Champion of Ireland for ever?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can be, if I will,&rdquo; said Laegaire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Follow my advice, and you shall be head of all the
champions of Ireland,&rdquo; said cunning Bricriu.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is your counsel?&rdquo; asked Laegaire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;King Conor is coming to a feast in my house,&rdquo; said
Bricriu, &ldquo;and the Champion&rsquo;s Bit will be a splendid
portion for any hero. That warrior who obtains it at
this feast will be acclaimed Chief Champion of Erin.
When the banquet begins do you bid your chariot-driver
rise and claim the hero&rsquo;s portion for you, for
you are indeed worthy of it, and I hope that you may
get what you so well deserve!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some men shall die if my right is taken from me,&rdquo;
quoth Laegaire; but Bricriu only laughed and turned
away.</p>


<h3>Bricriu Meets Conall Cearnach</h3>

<p>Bricriu next met Conall Cearnach, Cuchulain&rsquo;s cousin,
one of the chiefs of the Red Branch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May all good be with you, Conall the Victorious,&rdquo;
quoth he. &ldquo;You are our defence and shield, and no foe
dare face you in battle. Why should you not be Chief
Champion of Ulster?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It only depends on my will,&rdquo; said Conall; and then
Bricriu continued his flattery and insidious suggestions
until he had stirred up Conall to command his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg&nbsp;188]</a></span>
charioteer to claim the Champion&rsquo;s Portion at Bricriu&rsquo;s
feast. Very joyous was Bricriu, and very evilly he
smiled as he turned away when he had roused the
ambition of Conall Cearnach, for he revelled in the
prospect of coming strife.</p>


<h3>Bricriu Meets Cuchulain</h3>

<p>&ldquo;May all good be with you, Cuchulain,&rdquo; said Bricriu,
as he met the youthful hero. &ldquo;You are the chief
defence of Erin, our bulwark against the foe, our joy
and darling, the hero of Ulster, the favourite of all the
maidens of Ireland, the greatest warrior of our land!
We all live in safety under the protection of your
mighty hand, so why should you not be the Chief
Champion of Ulster? Why will you leave the Hero&rsquo;s
Portion to some less worthy warrior?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the god of my people, I will have it, or slay
any bold man who dares to deprive me of it,&rdquo; said
Cuchulain.</p>

<p>Thereupon Bricriu left Cuchulain and travelled to his
home, where he made his preparations for receiving the
king, as if nothing were further from his thoughts than
mischief-making and guile.</p>


<h3>The Feast and the Quarrel</h3>

<p>When King Conor and his court had entered
Bricriu&rsquo;s house at Dundrum, and were sitting at the
feast, Bricriu was forced by his sureties to leave the hall,
for men feared his malicious tongue, and as he went to
his watch-tower he turned and cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Champion&rsquo;s Portion at my feast is worth
having; let it be given to the best hero in Ulster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The carving and distribution of the viands began, and
when the Champion&rsquo;s Portion was brought forward it
was claimed by three chariot-drivers, Laegaire&rsquo;s, Conall&rsquo;s,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg&nbsp;189]</a></span>
and Cuchulain&rsquo;s, each on behalf of his master; and
when no decision was made by King Conor the three
heroes claimed it, each for himself. But Laegaire and
Conall united in defying Cuchulain and ridiculing his
claim, and a great fight began in the hall, till all men
shook for fear; and at last King Conor intervened,
before any man had been wounded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put up your swords,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The Champion&rsquo;s
Portion at this feast shall be divided among the three,
and we will ask King Ailill and Queen Meave of Connaught
to say who is the greatest champion.&rdquo; This
plan pleased every one but Bricriu, who saw his hopes
of fomenting strife disappear.</p>


<h3>The Women&rsquo;s Quarrel</h3>

<p>Just at that moment the women rose and quitted
the hall to breathe the fresh air, and Bricriu spied his
opportunity. Going down from his watch-tower, he
met Fedelm, the wife of Laegaire, with her fifty
maidens, and said to her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;All good be with you to-night, Fedelm of the
Fresh Heart! Truly in beauty, in birth, in dignity,
no woman in Ulster is your equal. If you enter my
hall first to-night, you will be queen of the Ulster
women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fedelm walked on merrily enough, but determined
that she would soon re-enter the hall, and certainly before
any other woman. Bricriu next met Lendabair the
Favourite, Conall&rsquo;s wife, and gave her similar flattery
and a similar prophecy, and Lendabair also determined
to be first back at the house and first to enter the hall.</p>

<p>Then Bricriu waited till he saw Emer, Cuchulain&rsquo;s
fair wife. &ldquo;Health be with you, Emer, wife of the
best man in Ireland! As the sun outshines the stars,
so do you outshine all other women! You should
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg&nbsp;190]</a></span>
of right enter the house first, for whoever does so will
be queen of the women of Ulster, and none has a better
claim to be their queen than Cuchulain&rsquo;s wife, Forgall&rsquo;s
fair daughter.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The Husbands Intervene</h3>

<p>The three fair women, each with her train of fifty
maidens, watched one another carefully, and when one
turned back towards the house the others accompanied
her, step for step; and the noise of their returning
footsteps as they raced along alarmed their husbands.
Sencha, the king&rsquo;s wise counsellor, reassured them, saying,
&ldquo;It is only a woman&rsquo;s quarrel; Bricriu has stirred
up enmity among the wives of the heroes&rdquo;; and as he
spoke Emer reached the hall, having suddenly outrun
the others; but the doors were shut. Then followed
bitter complaints from Fedelm and Lendabair, both
united against Emer, as their husbands had been against
Cuchulain. Again King Conor was forced to call for
silence, since each hero was supporting his own wife&rsquo;s
claims to be queen of the Ulster women. The strife
was only calmed by the promise that the claim to the
highest place should be settled by Ailill and Meave of
Connaught, who would be impartial judges.</p>


<h3>The Heroes Journey to Connaught</h3>

<p>Bricriu&rsquo;s feast lasted for three days longer, and then
King Conor and the Red Branch heroes returned to
Armagh. There the dispute about the Championship
began again, and Conor sent the heroes to Cruachan, in
Connaught, to obtain a judgment from King Ailill.
&ldquo;If he does not decide, go to Curoi of Munster, who
is a just and wise man, and will find out the best hero
by wizardry and enchantments.&rdquo; When Conor had
decided thus, Laegaire and Conall, after some disputation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg&nbsp;191]</a></span>
as to who should start first, had their chariots
got ready and drove towards Cruachan, but Cuchulain
stayed amusing himself and the women in Armagh.
When his chariot-driver reproached him with losing
the Champion&rsquo;s Portion through laziness Cuchulain
replied: &ldquo;I never thought about it, but there is still
time to win it. Yoke my steeds to the chariot.&rdquo; By this
time, however, the other two heroes were far, very far,
in advance, with the chief men of Ulster following
them.</p>


<h3>Cuchulain&rsquo;s Steeds</h3>

<p>Cuchulain had quite lately won two mighty magic
steeds, which arose from two lonely lakes&mdash;the Grey
of Macha, his best-beloved horse, and the Black Sainglain.
The struggle between the hero and these magic
steeds had been terrible before he had been able to
tame them and reduce them to submission; now he
had them yoked to his chariot, and when he had once
started he soon came up with the other two heroes, and
all three drove furiously towards Cruachan, with all the
warriors of Ulster behind them.</p>

<p>The noise of the advancing war-chariots reached
Queen Meave at Cruachan, and she wondered greatly
to hear thunder from a clear sky; but her fair daughter,
looking from her window, said: &ldquo;Mother, I see chariots
coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who comes in the first?&rdquo; asked Queen Meave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see a big stout man, with reddish gold hair and
long forked beard, dressed in purple with gold adornments;
and his shield is bronze edged with gold; he
bears a javelin in his hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That man I know well,&rdquo; answered her mother.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg&nbsp;192]</a></span>
&ldquo;He is mighty Laegaire, the Storm of War, the Knife of
Victory; he will slay us all, unless he comes in peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see another chariot,&rdquo; quoth the princess, &ldquo;bearing
a fair man with long wavy hair, a man of clear red and
white complexion, wearing a white vest and a cloak
of blue and crimson. His shield is brown, with yellow
bosses and a bronze edge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is valiant Conall the Victorious,&rdquo; quoth
Meave. &ldquo;Small chance shall we have if he comes in
anger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet a third chariot comes, wherein stands a dark,
sad youth, most handsome of all the men of Erin; he
wears a crimson tunic, brooched with gold, a long white
linen cloak, and a white, gold-embroidered hood. His
hair is black, his look draws love, his glance shoots fire,
and the hero-light gleams around him. His shield is
crimson, with a silver rim, and images of beasts shine on
it in gold.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>Terror in Connaught</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Alas! that is the hero Cuchulain,&rdquo; said Meave.
&ldquo;He is more to be feared than all others. His voice
in anger tells the doom of men; his wrath is fatal.
Truly we are but dead if we have aroused Cuchulain&rsquo;s
wrath.&rdquo; After a pause: &ldquo;Tell me, daughter, are there
yet other chariots?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The men of Ulster follow in chariots so numerous
that the earth quakes beneath them, and their sound is
as thunder, or the dashing waves of the sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now Queen Meave was terrified in good earnest, but
hoped by a hearty welcome to turn aside the wrath of
the heroes of Ulster; thus when they arrived at the
dun of Cruachan they found the best of receptions, and
all the Red Branch warriors were feasted for three days
and nights.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg&nbsp;193]</a></span></p>

<h3>Conor Explains the Matter</h3>

<p>After three days Ailill of Connaught asked their
business, and King Conor related to him everything as
it had occurred&mdash;the feast, the dispute for the Champion&rsquo;s
Portion, the women&rsquo;s quarrel, and the decision
to be judged by King Ailill. This angered Ailill, who
was a peaceable man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was no friend of mine who referred you to me,
for I shall surely incur the hatred of two heroes,&rdquo;
quoth he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are the best judge of all,&rdquo; replied King Conor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I must have time&mdash;three days and nights&mdash;to
decide,&rdquo; said Ailill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can spare our heroes so long,&rdquo; quoth Conor, and
therewith the Ulster men returned to Armagh, leaving
the three claimants to the Championship at Cruachan.</p>


<h3>The First Test</h3>

<p>That night Ailill put them to an unexpected test.
Their feast was served to them in a separate room, and
the king went to his protectors, the Fairy People of
the Hills, in the Good People&rsquo;s Hill at Cruachan, and
begged some help in his judgment. They willingly
aided him, and three magic beasts, in the shape of
monstrous cats, were let into the room where the
heroes feasted. When they saw them Laegaire and
Conall rose up from their meal, clambered up among
the rafters, and stayed there all night. Cuchulain waited
till one attacked him, and then drawing his sword, struck
the monster. It showed no further sign of fight, and
Cuchulain kept watch all night, till the magic beasts
disappeared at daybreak. When Ailill came into the
room and saw the heroes as they had spent the night
he laughed as he said:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg&nbsp;194]</a></span>
&ldquo;Are you not content to yield the Championship to
Cuchulain?&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 413px;">
<img src="images/hmlbr28.jpg" width="413" height="600" alt="" />
<a name="image_page_192" id="image_page_192"></a>
</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;Three monstrous cats were let into the room&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed no,&rdquo; said Conall and Laegaire. &ldquo;We are used
to fighting men, not monstrous beasts.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The Second Test</h3>

<p>The next day King Ailill sent the heroes to his own
foster-father, Ercol, to spend a night with him, that he
also might test them. When they arrived, and had
feasted, Laegaire was sent out that night to fight the
witches of the valley. Fierce and terrible were these
witches, and they beat Laegaire, and took his arms and
armour.</p>

<p>When Conall went to fight them the witches beat
him and took his spear, but he kept his sword and
brought it back with honour. Cuchulain, who was the
youngest, went last, and he too was being beaten,
when the taunts of his chariot-driver, who was watching,
aroused him, and he beat the witches, and bore off in
triumph their cloaks of battle. Yet even after this
the other two heroes would not acknowledge Cuchulain&rsquo;s
superiority.</p>


<h3>Ercol&rsquo;s Defeat</h3>

<p>The next day Ercol fought with each champion
separately, and conquered both Laegaire and Conall,
terrifying the former so much that he fled to Cruachan
and told Meave and Ailill that Ercol had killed the
other two. When Cuchulain arrived victorious, with
Ercol tied captive at his chariot-wheels, he found all
men mourning for him and Conall as for the dead.</p>


<h3>Meave&rsquo;s Plan to Avoid Strife in Cruachan</h3>

<p>Now indeed Ailill was in great perplexity, for he
durst not delay his decision, and he dreaded the wrath
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg&nbsp;195]</a></span>
of the two disappointed heroes. He and Queen Meave
consulted long together, and at length Meave promised
to relieve him of the responsibility of judgment.
Summoning Laegaire to the king&rsquo;s room, she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Welcome, O Laegaire! You are greatest of the
warriors of Ulster. To you we give the headship of
the heroes of Ireland and the Champion&rsquo;s Portion, and
to your wife the right to walk first of all the women of
Ulster. In token thereof we give you this cup of
bronze with a silver bird embossed, to be seen by no
man till you be come to King Conor in the Red Branch
House at Armagh. Then show your cup and claim
your right, and none will dispute it with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Laegaire went away well pleased, and they sent
for Conall. To him they gave a silver cup, with a bird
embossed in gold, and to him they pretended to adjudge
the Championship, and Conall left them well content.</p>

<p>Cuchulain, who was playing chess, refused to attend
the King of Connaught when he was summoned, and
Queen Meave had to entreat him to come to their
private room. There they gave him a golden cup,
with a bird designed in precious gems, with many
words of flattery for Cuchulain and his fair and noble
wife, Emer.</p>


<h3>The Return of the Champions</h3>

<p>Now the heroes, each well content, bade farewell to
the court at Cruachan, and drove back to Armagh, but
none durst ask how they had sped. That evening,
at the banquet, when the Champion&rsquo;s Portion was set
aside, Laegaire arose and claimed it, showing as proof
that his claim was just the bronze cup he brought from
Queen Meave.</p>

<p>But alas! Conall the Victorious had a silver cup, and
while he was exulting in this proof of his rightful claim
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg&nbsp;196]</a></span>
to the championship Cuchulain produced his golden
cup, and the dispute began all over again. King Conor
would have allowed Cuchulain&rsquo;s claim, but Laegaire
vowed that his rival had bribed Ailill and Meave with
great treasures to give him the golden cup, and neither
Laegaire nor Conall would yield him the victory or
accept the judgment as final. &ldquo;Then you must go to
Curoi,&rdquo; said the king, and to that they all agreed.</p>


<h3>The Champions Visit Curoi</h3>

<p>The next day the three champions drove to Kerry
where Curoi dwelt in a magic dun. He was away from
home planning enchantments to test them, for he knew
they were coming, but his wife welcomed them, and
bade them watch the dun for one night each, beginning
with Laegaire, as the eldest. Laegaire took up
his sentinel&rsquo;s post outside the dun, and Curoi&rsquo;s wife
worked the charm which prevented entrance after nightfall.
The night was long and silent, and Laegaire
thought he would have a quiet watch, when he saw a
great shadow arise from the sea.</p>


<h3>The Giant Fights Laegaire and Conall</h3>

<p>This shadow took the shape of a huge giant, whose
spears were mighty branch-stripped oaks, which he
hurled at Laegaire. They did not touch him, however,
and Laegaire made some show of fight; but the giant
took him up, squeezed him so tightly as nearly to slay
him, and then threw him over the magic wall of the dun,
where the others found him lying half dead. All men
thought that he had sprung with a mighty leap over
the wall, since no other entrance was to be found, and
Laegaire kept silence and did not explain to them.</p>

<p>Conall, who took the watch the second night, fared
exactly as Laegaire had done, and likewise did not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg&nbsp;197]</a></span>
confess how he had been thrown over the wall of the
dun, nor what became of the giant in the dawn.</p>


<h3>Cuchulain&rsquo;s Trials</h3>

<p>The third night was Cuchulain&rsquo;s watch, and he took his
post outside the dun, and the gates and wall were secured
by magic spells, so that none could enter. Vainly he
watched till midnight, and then he thought he saw nine
grey shadowy forms creeping towards him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who goes there?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;If you be friends,
stop; if foes, come on!&rdquo; Then the nine shadowy foes
raised a shout, and fell upon the hero; but he fought
hard and slew them, and beheaded them. A second
and a third time similar groups of vague, shadowy foemen
rushed at him, and he slew them all in like manner,
and then, wearied out, sat down to rest.</p>


<h3>The Dragon</h3>

<p>Later on in the night, as he was still watching, he
heard a heavy sound, like waves surging in the lake, and
when he roused himself to see what it was he beheld a
monstrous dragon. It was rising from the water and flying
towards the dun, and seemed ready to devour everything
in its way. When the dragon perceived him it
soared swiftly into the air, and then gradually sank
towards him, opening its terrible jaws. Cuchulain
sprang up, giving his wonderful hero-leap, and thrust
his arm into the dragon&rsquo;s mouth and down its throat;
he found its heart, tore it out, and saw the monster fall
dead on the ground. He then cut off its scaly head,
which he added to those of his former enemies.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 404px;">
<img src="images/hmlbr29.jpg" width="404" height="600" alt="" />
<a name="image_page_196" id="image_page_196"></a>
</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;The dragon sank towards him, opening its terrible jaws&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The Giant Worsted by Cuchulain</h3>

<p>Towards daybreak, when feeling quite worn out
and very sleepy, he became slowly aware of a great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg&nbsp;198]</a></span>
shadow coming to him westward from the sea. The
shadow, as before, became a giant, who greeted him
in a surly tone with, &ldquo;This is a bad night.&rdquo; &ldquo;It will
be worse yet for you,&rdquo; said Cuchulain. The giant, as
he had done with the other heroes, threw oaks, but just
missed him; and when he tried to grapple with him
the hero leaped up with drawn sword. In his anger
the hero-light shone round him, and he sprang as high
as the giant&rsquo;s head, and gave him a stroke that brought
him to his knees. &ldquo;Life for life, Cuchulain,&rdquo; said the
giant, and vanished at once, leaving no trace.</p>


<h3>Cuchulain Re-enters the Dun</h3>

<p>Now Cuchulain would gladly have returned to the
fort to rest, but there seemed no way of entrance, and
the hero was vexed at his own helplessness, for he
thought his comrades had jumped over the magic walls.
Twice he boldly essayed to leap the lofty wall, and
twice he failed; then in his wrath his great strength
came upon him, the hero-light shone round him, and
he took a little run and, leaning on his spear, leaped so
high and so far that he alighted in the middle of the
court, just before the door of the hall.</p>

<p>As he sighed heavily and wearily, Curoi&rsquo;s wife said:
&ldquo;That is the sigh of a weary conqueror, not of a beaten
man&rdquo;; and Cuchulain went in and sat down to rest.</p>


<h3>The Decision</h3>

<p>The next morning Curoi&rsquo;s wife asked the champions:
&ldquo;Are you content that the Championship should go to
Cuchulain? I know by my magic skill what he has
endured in the past night, and you must see that you
are not equal to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, that we will not allow,&rdquo; quoth they. &ldquo;It
was one of Cuchulain&rsquo;s friends among the People of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg&nbsp;199]</a></span>
the Hills who came to conquer us and to give him the
Championship. We are not content, and we will not
give up our claim, for the fight was not fair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go home now to Armagh, is Curoi&rsquo;s word, and wait
there until he himself brings his decision,&rdquo; said Curoi&rsquo;s
wife. So they bade her farewell, and went back to the
Red Branch House in Armagh, with the dispute still
unsettled; but they agreed to await peaceably Curoi&rsquo;s
decision, and abide by it when he should bring it.</p>


<h3>Uath, the Stranger</h3>

<p>Some time after this, when Curoi had made no sign
of giving judgment, it happened that all the Ulster
heroes were in their places in the Red Branch House,
except Cuchulain and his cousin Conall. As they sat
in order of rank in the hall they saw a terrible stranger
coming into the room. He was gigantic in stature,
hideous of aspect, with ravening yellow eyes. He wore
a skin roughly sewn together, and a grey cloak over it,
and he sheltered himself from the light with a spreading
tree torn up by the roots. In his hand he bore an
enormous axe, with keen and shining edge. This hideous
apparition strode up the hall and leant against a carved
pillar beside the fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; asked one chieftain in sport.
&ldquo;Are you come to be our candlestick, or would you
burn the house down? Is this the place for such as
you? Go farther down the hall!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is Uath, the Stranger, and for neither of
those things am I come. I seek that which I cannot
find in the whole world, and that is a man to keep the
agreement he makes with me.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The Agreement</h3>

<p>&ldquo;What is the agreement?&rdquo; asked King Conor.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg&nbsp;200]</a></span>
&ldquo;Behold my axe!&rdquo; quoth the stranger. &ldquo;The man
who will grasp it to-day may cut my head off with it,
provided that I may, in like manner, cut off his head
to-morrow. Now you men of Ulster, heroes of the
Red Branch, have won the palm through the wide world
for courage, honour, strength, truth, and generosity;
do you, therefore, find me a man to keep this agreement.
King Conor is excepted, because of his royal
dignity, but no other. And if you have no champion
who dare face me, I will say that Ulster has lost her
courage and is dishonoured.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not right for a whole province to be disgraced
for lack of a man to keep his word,&rdquo; said King Conor,
&ldquo;but I fear we have no such champions here.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>Laegaire Accepts the Challenge</h3>

<p>&ldquo;By my word,&rdquo; said Laegaire, who had listened
attentively to the whole conversation, &ldquo;there will be
a champion this very moment. Stoop down, fellow,
and let me cut off your head, that you may take mine
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Uath chanted magic spells over the axe as he
stroked the edge, and laid his neck on a block, and
Laegaire hewed so hard that the axe severed the head
from the body and struck deep into the block. Then
the body of Uath arose, took up the head and the axe,
and strode away down the hall, all people shrinking out
of its way, and so it passed out into the night.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 411px;">
<img src="images/hmlbr30.jpg" width="411" height="600" alt="" />
<a name="image_page_200" id="image_page_200"></a>
</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;The body of Uath arose&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If this terrible stranger returns to-morrow he will
slay us all,&rdquo; they whispered, as they looked pityingly at
Laegaire, who was trying in vain to show no signs of
apprehension.</p>


<h3>Laegaire and Conall Disgraced</h3>

<p>When the next evening came, and men sat in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg&nbsp;201]</a></span>
Red Branch House, talking little and waiting for what
would happen, in came Uath, the Stranger, as well
and sound as before the terrible blow, bearing his axe,
and eager to return the stroke. Alas! Laegaire&rsquo;s heart
had failed him and he did not come, and the stranger
jeered at the men of Ulster because their great champion
durst not keep his agreement, nor face the blow
he should receive in return for one he gave.</p>

<p>The men of Ulster were utterly ashamed, but Conall
Cearnach, the Victorious, was present that night, and he
made a new agreement with Uath. Conall gave a blow
which beheaded Uath, but again, when the stranger
returned whole and sound on the following evening, the
champion was not to be found: Conall would not face
the blow.</p>


<h3>Cuchulain Accepts the Challenge</h3>

<p>When Uath found that a second hero of Ulster had
failed him he again taunted them all with cowardice and
promise-breaking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! is there not one man of courage among you
Ulstermen? You would fain have a great name, but
have no courage to earn it! Great heroes are you all!
Not one among you has bravery enough to face me!
Where is that childish youth Cuchulain! A poor
miserable fellow he is, but I would like to see if his
word is better to be relied on than the word of these
two great heroes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A youth I may be,&rdquo; said Cuchulain, &ldquo;but I will
keep my word without any agreement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uath laughed aloud. &ldquo;Yes! that is likely, is it not?
And you with so great a fear of death!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thereupon the youth leapt up, caught the deadly
axe, and severed the giant&rsquo;s head as he stood with one
stroke.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg&nbsp;202]</a></span></p>

<h3>Cuchulain Stands the Test</h3>

<p>The next day the Red Branch heroes watched Cuchulain
to see what he would do. They would not have
been surprised if he had failed like the others, who now
were present. The champion, however, showed no signs
of failing or retreat. He sat sorrowfully in his place
waiting for the certain death that must come, and regretting
his rashness, but with no thought of breaking
his word.</p>

<p>With a sigh he said to King Conor as they waited:
&ldquo;Do not leave this place till all is over. Death is
coming to me very surely, but I must fulfil my agreement,
for I would rather die than break my word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Towards the close of day Uath strode into the hall
exultant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Cuchulain?&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here I am,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, poor boy! your speech is sad to-night, and
the fear of death lies heavy on you; but at least you
have redeemed your word and have not failed me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The youth rose from his seat and went towards Uath,
as he stood with the great axe ready, and knelt to
receive the blow.</p>


<h3>Curoi&rsquo;s Decision and Cuchulain&rsquo;s Victory</h3>

<p>The hero of Ulster laid his head on the block;
but Uath was not satisfied. &ldquo;Stretch out your neck
better,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are playing with me, to torment me,&rdquo; said
Cuchulain. &ldquo;Slay me now speedily, for I did not keep
you waiting last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, he stretched out his neck as Uath bade, and
the stranger raised his axe till it crashed upwards through
the rafters of the hall, like the crash of trees falling in a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg&nbsp;203]</a></span>
storm. When the axe came down with a terrific sound
all men looked fearfully at Cuchulain. The descending
axe had not even touched him; it had come down with
the blunt side on the ground, and the youth knelt there
unharmed. Smiling at him, and leaning on his axe,
stood no terrible and hideous stranger, but Curoi of
Kerry, come to give his decision at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rise up, Cuchulain,&rdquo; said Curoi. &ldquo;There is none
among all the heroes of Ulster to equal you in courage
and loyalty and truth. The Championship of the
Heroes of Ireland is yours from this day forth, and the
Champion&rsquo;s Portion at all feasts; and to your wife I
adjudge the first place among all the women of Ulster.
Woe to him who dares to dispute this decision!&rdquo;
Thereupon Curoi vanished, and the Red Branch warriors
gathered around Cuchulain, and all with one voice
acclaimed him the Champion of the Heroes of all Ireland&mdash;a
title which has clung to him until this day.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X: THE TALE OF
GAMELYN</h2>


<h3>The &ldquo;Wicked Brothers&rdquo; Theme</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE tale of &ldquo;Gamelyn&rdquo; is a variant of the old
fairy-tale subject of the Wicked Elder Brothers,
one of the oldest and most interesting versions of
which may still be read in the Biblical story of Joseph and
his brethren. Usually a father dies leaving three sons,
of whom the two elder are worthless and the youngest
rises to high honour, whereupon the elder brothers try
to kill the youngest from envy at his good fortune. A
similar root-idea is found in &ldquo;Cinderella&rdquo; and other
fairy-tales of girls, but in these there may usually be
found a cruel stepmother and two contemptuous stepsisters&mdash;a
noteworthy variation which seems to point to
some deep-rooted idea that the ties of blood are stronger
among women than among men.</p>


<h3>Literary Influence of the &ldquo;Gamelyn&rdquo; Story</h3>

<p>The story of &ldquo;Gamelyn&rdquo; has two great claims to our
attention: it is, through Lodge&rsquo;s &ldquo;Euphues&rsquo; Golden
Legacy,&rdquo; the ultimate source of Shakespeare&rsquo;s <i>As You
Like It</i>, and it seems to be the earliest presentment in
English literature of the figure of &ldquo;the noble outlaw.&rdquo;
In fact, Gamelyn is probably the literary ancestor of
&ldquo;bold Robin Hood,&rdquo; and stands for an English
ideal of justice and equity, against legal oppression and
wickedness in high places. He shows, too, the love of
free life, of the merry greenwood and the open road,
which reappears after so many centuries in the work of
Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>


<h3>The Story</h3>

<p>In the reign of King Edward I. there dwelt in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg&nbsp;205]</a></span>
Lincolnshire, near the vast expanse of the Fens, a noble
gentleman, Sir John of the Marches. He was now old,
but was still a model of all courtesy and a &ldquo;very perfect
gentle knight.&rdquo; He had three sons, of whom the
youngest, Gamelyn, was born in his father&rsquo;s old age, and
was greatly beloved by the old man; the other two were
much older than he, and John, the eldest, had already
developed a vicious and malignant character. Gamelyn
and his second brother, Otho, reverenced their father,
but John had no respect or obedience for the good
gentleman, and was the chief trouble of his declining
years, as Gamelyn was his chief joy.</p>


<h3>The Father Feels his End Approaching</h3>

<p>At last old age and weakness overcame the worthy
old Sir John, and he was forced to take to his bed,
where he lay sadly meditating on his children&rsquo;s future,
and wondering how to divide his possessions justly
among the three. There was no difficulty of inheritance
or primogeniture, for all the knight&rsquo;s lands were held in
fee-simple, and not in entail, so that he might bequeath
them as he would. Sir John of the Marches, fearing
lest he should commit an injustice, sent throughout the
district for wise knights, begging them to come hastily,
if they wished to see him alive, and help him. When
the country squires and lords, his near neighbours,
heard of his grave condition, they hurried to the castle,
and gathered in the bedchamber, where the dying knight
greeted them thus: &ldquo;Lords and gentlemen, I warn
you in truth that I may no longer live; by the will of
God death lays his hand upon me.&rdquo; When they heard
this they tried to encourage him, by bidding him
remember that God can provide a remedy for every
disease, and the good knight received their kindly words
without dispute. &ldquo;That God can send remedy for an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg&nbsp;206]</a></span>
ill I will never deny; but I beseech you, for my sake,
to divide my lands among my three sons. For the
love of God deal justly, and forget not my youngest,
Gamelyn. Seldom does any heir to an estate help his
brothers after his father&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>How Shall he Dispose of his Estate?</h3>

<p>The friends whom Sir John had summoned deliberated
long over the disposal of the estate. The majority
wished to give all to the eldest son, but a strong
minority urged the claims of the second, but all agreed
that Gamelyn might wait till his eldest brother chose to
give him a share of his father&rsquo;s lands. At last it was
decided to divide the inheritance between the two elder
sons, and the knights returned to the chamber where
the brave old knight lay dying, and told him their
decision. He summoned up strength enough to protest
against their plan of distribution, and said:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Nay, by St. Martin, I can yet bequeath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My lands to whom I wish: they still are mine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then hearken, neighbours, while I make my will.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To John, my eldest son, and heir, I leave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Five ploughlands, my dead father&rsquo;s heritage;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My second, Otho, ploughlands five shall hold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which my good right hand won in valiant strife;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All else I own, in lands and goods and wealth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Gamelyn, my youngest, I devise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I beseech you, for the love of God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forsake him not, but guard his helpless youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let him not be plundered of his wealth.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then Sir John, satisfied with having proclaimed his
will, died with Christian resignation, leaving his little
son Gamelyn in the power of the cruel eldest brother,
now, in his turn, Sir John.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg&nbsp;207]</a></span></p>

<h3>The Cruel Eldest Son</h3>

<p>Since the boy was a minor, the new knight, as
natural guardian, assumed the control of Gamelyn&rsquo;s
land, vassals, education, and nurture; and full evilly he
discharged his duties, for he clothed and fed him badly,
and neglected his lands, so that his parks and houses,
his farms and villages, fell into ruinous decay. The boy,
when he grew older, noticed this and resented it, but
did not realize the power in his own broad limbs and
mighty sinews to redress his wrongs, though by the
time he fully understood his injuries no man would
dare to face him in fight when he was angry, so strong
a youth had he become.</p>


<h3>Gamelyn Resists</h3>

<p>While Gamelyn, one day, walking in the hall, mused
on the ruin of all his inheritance, Sir John came blustering
in, and, seeing him, called out: &ldquo;How now: is
dinner ready?&rdquo; Enraged at being addressed as if he
were a mere servant, he replied angrily: &ldquo;Go and do
your own baking; I am not your cook.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 415px;">
<img src="images/hmlbr31.jpg" width="415" height="600" alt="" />
<a name="image_page_206" id="image_page_206"></a>
</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;Go and do your own baking!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir John almost doubted the evidence of his ears.
&ldquo;What, my dear brother, is that the way to answer?
Thou hast never addressed me so before!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Gamelyn; &ldquo;until now I have never
considered all the wrong you have done me. My parks
are broken open, my deer are driven off; you have
deprived me of my armour and my steeds; all that my
father bequeathed to me is falling into ruin and decay.
God&rsquo;s curse upon you, false brother!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir John was now enraged beyond all measure, and
shouted: &ldquo;Stand still, vagabond, and hold thy peace!
What right hast thou to speak of land or vassals? Thou
shalt learn to be grateful for food and raiment.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg&nbsp;208]</a></span>
&ldquo;A curse upon him that calls me vagabond! I am
no worse than yourself; I am the son of a lady and a
good knight.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>Gamelyn Terrifies the Household</h3>

<p>In spite of all his anger, Sir John was a cautious man,
with a prudent regard for his own safety. He would
not risk an encounter with Gamelyn, but summoned
his servants and bade them beat him well, till he should
learn better manners. But when the boy understood
his brother&rsquo;s intention he vowed that he would not be
beaten alone&mdash;others should suffer too, and Sir John
not the least. Thereupon, leaping on to the wall, he
seized a pestle which lay there, and so boldly attacked
the timid servants, though they were armed with staves,
that he drove them in flight, and laid on furious strokes
which quenched the small spark of courage in them.
Sir John had not even that small amount of bravery:
he fled to a loft and barred the door, while Gamelyn
cleared the hall with his pestle, and scoffed at the
cowardly grooms who fled so soon from the strife they
had begun. When he sought for his brother he could
not see him at first, but afterwards perceived his sorry
countenance peeping from a window. &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said
Gamelyn, &ldquo;come a little nearer, and I will teach you
how to play with staff and buckler.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, by St. Richard, I will not descend till thou
hast put down that pestle. Brother, be no more
enraged, and I will make peace with thee. I swear it
by the grace of God!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was forced to defend myself,&rdquo; said Gamelyn,
&ldquo;or your menials would have injured and degraded
me: I could not let grooms beat a good knight&rsquo;s
son; but now grant me one boon, and we shall soon
be reconciled.&rdquo;</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg&nbsp;209]</a></span></p>

<h3>Sir John&rsquo;s Guile</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, certainly, brother; ask thy boon, and I will
grant it readily. But indeed I was only testing thee,
for thou art so young that I doubted thy strength and
manliness. It was only a pretence of beating that I
meant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is my request,&rdquo; said the boy: &ldquo;if there is
to be peace between us you must surrender to me all
that my father bequeathed me while he was alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To this Sir John consented with apparent willingness,
and even promised to repair the decayed mansions
and restore the lands and farms to their former prosperity;
but though he feigned content with the agreement
and kissed his brother with outward affection
yet he was inwardly meditating plans of treachery
against the unsuspecting youth.</p>


<h3>A Wrestling Match</h3>

<p>Shortly after this quarrel between the brothers a
wrestling competition was announced, the winner of
which would become the owner of a fine ram and a ring
of gold, and Gamelyn determined to try his powers.
Accordingly he begged the loan of &ldquo;a little courser&rdquo;
from Sir John, who offered him his choice of all the
steeds in the stable, and then curiously questioned
him as to his errand. The lad explained that he
wished to compete in the wrestling match, hoping to
win honour by bearing away the prize; then, springing
on the beautiful courser that was brought him ready
saddled, he spurred his horse and rode away merrily,
while the false Sir John locked the gate behind him,
praying that he might get his neck broken in the
contest. The boy rode along, rejoicing in his youth
and strength, singing as he went, till he drew near the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg&nbsp;210]</a></span>
appointed place, and then he suddenly heard a man&rsquo;s
voice lamenting aloud and crying, &ldquo;Wellaway! Alas!&rdquo;
and saw a venerable yeoman wringing his hands.
&ldquo;Good man,&rdquo; said Gamelyn, &ldquo;why art thou in such
distress? Can no man help thee?&rdquo;</p>


<h3>A Dreaded Champion</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said the yeoman. &ldquo;Woe to the day on
which I was born! The champion wrestler here has
overthrown my two stalwart sons, and unless God
help them they must die of their grievous hurts. I
would give ten pounds to find a man to avenge on
him the injuries done to my dear sons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good man, hold my horse while my groom takes
my coat and shoes, and I will try my luck and strength
against this doughty champion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; said the yeoman. &ldquo;I will do it at
once; I will guard thy coat and shoes and good steed
safely&mdash;and may Jesus Christ speed thee well!&rdquo;</p>


<h3>Gamelyn Enters</h3>

<p>When Gamelyn entered the ring, barefooted and
stripped for wrestling, all men gazed curiously at the
rash youth who dared to challenge the stalwart champion,
and the great man himself, rising from the ground,
strolled across to meet Gamelyn and said haughtily:
&ldquo;Who is thy father, and what is thy name? Thou
art, forsooth, a young fool to come here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gamelyn answered equally haughtily: &ldquo;Thou
knewest well my father while he lived: he was Sir
John of the Marches, and I am his youngest son,
Gamelyn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The champion replied: &ldquo;Boy, I knew thy father
well in his lifetime, and I have heard of thee, and
nothing good: thou hast always been in mischief.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg&nbsp;211]</a></span>
&ldquo;Now I am older thou shalt know me better,&rdquo; said
Gamelyn.</p>


<h3>Defeats the Champion</h3>

<p>The wrestling had lasted till late in the evening, and
the moon was shining on the scene when Gamelyn and
the champion began their struggle. The wrestler tried
many wily tricks, but the boy was ready for them all,
and stood steady against all that his opponent could do.
Then, in his turn, he took the offensive, grasped his
adversary round the waist, and cast him so heavily to
the ground that three ribs were broken, and his left
arm. Then the victor said mockingly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we count that a cast, or not reckon it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By heaven! whether it be one or no, any man in thy
hand will never thrive,&rdquo; said the champion painfully.</p>

<p>The yeoman, who had watched the match with great
anxiety, now broke out with blessings: &ldquo;Blessed be
thou, young sir, that ever thou wert born!&rdquo; and now
taunting the fallen champion, said: &ldquo;It was young
&lsquo;Mischief&rsquo; who taught thee this game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is master of us all,&rdquo; said the champion. &ldquo;In
all my years of wrestling I have never been mishandled
so cruelly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now the victor stood in the ring, ready for more
wrestling, but no man would venture to compete with
him, and the two judges who kept order and awarded
the prizes bade him retire, for no other competitor
could be found to face him.</p>

<p>But he was a little disappointed at this easy victory.
&ldquo;Is the fair over? Why, I have not half sold my
wares,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>The champion was still capable of grim jesting.
&ldquo;Now, as I value my life, any purchaser of your wares
is a fool; you sell so dearly.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg&nbsp;212]</a></span>
&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; broke in the yeoman; &ldquo;you have bought
your share full cheap, and made a good bargain.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>He Wins the Prizes</h3>

<p>While this short conversation had been going on the
judges had returned to their seats, and formally awarded
the prize to Gamelyn, and now came to him, bearing
the ram and the ring for his acceptance.</p>

<p>Gamelyn took them gladly, and went home the next
morning, followed by a cheering crowd of admirers;
but when the cowardly Sir John saw the people he
bolted the castle doors against his more favourite and
successful brother.</p>


<h3>He Overcomes his Brother&rsquo;s Servants</h3>

<p>The porter, obeying his master&rsquo;s commands, refused
Gamelyn entrance; and the youth, enraged at this
insult, broke down the door with one blow, caught the
fleeing porter, and flung him down the well in the
courtyard. His brother&rsquo;s servants fled from his anger,
and the crowd that had accompanied him swarmed
into courtyard and hall, while the knight took refuge in
a little turret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Welcome to you all,&rdquo; said Gamelyn. &ldquo;We will be
masters here and ask no man&rsquo;s leave. Yesterday I left
five tuns of wine in the cellar; we will drain them dry
before you go. If my brother objects (as he well may,
for he is a miser) I will be butler and caterer and
manage the whole feast. Any person who dares to
object may join the porter in the well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Naturally no objections were raised, and Gamelyn and
his friends held high revel for a week, while Sir John
lay hidden in his turret, terrified at the noise and
revelry, and dreading what his brother might do to
him now he had so great a following.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg&nbsp;213]</a></span></p>

<h3>A Reckoning with Sir John</h3>

<p>However, the guests departed quietly on the eighth
day, leaving Gamelyn alone, and very sorrowful, in the
hall where he had held high revel. As he stood there,
musing sadly, he heard a timid footstep, and saw his
brother creeping towards him. When he had attracted
Gamelyn&rsquo;s attention he spoke out loudly: &ldquo;Who made
thee so bold as to destroy all my household stores?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, brother, be not wroth,&rdquo; said the youth quietly.
&ldquo;If I have used anything I have paid for it fully beforehand.
For these sixteen years you have had full use
and profit of fifteen good ploughlands which my father
left me; you have also the use and increase of all my
cattle and horses; and now all this past profit I abandon
to you, in return for the expense of this feast of mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then said the treacherous Sir John: &ldquo;Hearken,
my dear brother: I have no son, and thou shalt be my
heir&mdash;I swear by the holy St. John.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In faith,&rdquo; said Gamelyn, &ldquo;if that be the case, and if
this offer be made in all sincerity, may God reward
you!&rdquo; for it was impossible for his generous disposition
to suspect his brother of treachery and to fathom the
wiles of a crafty nature; hence it happened that he was
so soon and easily beguiled.</p>


<h3>Gamelyn Allows Himself to be Chained</h3>

<p>Sir John hesitated a moment, and then said doubtfully:
&ldquo;There is one thing I must tell you, Gamelyn. When
you threw my porter into the well I swore in my wrath
that I would have you bound hand and foot. That
is impossible now without your consent, and I must be
forsworn unless you will let yourself be bound for a
moment, as a mere form, just to save me from the sin
of perjury.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg&nbsp;214]</a></span>
So sincere Sir John seemed, and so simple did the
whole thing appear, that Gamelyn consented at once.
&ldquo;Why, certainly, brother, you shall not be forsworn for
my sake.&rdquo; So he sat down, and the servants bound him
hand and foot; and then Sir John looked mockingly at
him as he said: &ldquo;So now, my fine brother, I have you
caught at last.&rdquo; Then he bade them bring fetters and
rivet them on Gamelyn&rsquo;s limbs, and chain him fast to a
post in the centre of the hall. Then he was placed on
his feet with his back to the post and his hands manacled
behind him, and as he stood there the false brother told
every person who entered that Gamelyn had suddenly
gone mad, and was chained for safety&rsquo;s sake, lest he should
do himself or others some deadly hurt. For two long
days and nights he stood there bound, with no food or
drink, and grew faint with hunger and weariness, for
his fetters were so tight that he could not sit or lie
down; bitterly he lamented the carelessness which made
him fall such an easy prey to his treacherous brother&rsquo;s
designs.</p>


<h3>Adam Spencer to the Rescue</h3>

<p>When all others had left the hall Gamelyn appealed
to old Adam Spencer, the steward of the household,
a loyal old servant who had known Sir John of the
Marches, and had watched the boy grow up. &ldquo;Adam
Spencer,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;unless my brother is minded to
slay me, I am kept fasting too long. I beseech thee,
for the great love my father bore thee, get the keys and
release me from my bonds. I will share all my free
land with thee if thou wilt help me in this distress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The poor old servant was greatly perplexed. He knew
not how to reconcile his grateful loyalty to his dead master
with the loyalty due to his present lord, and he said
doubtfully: &ldquo;I have served thy brother for sixteen years,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg&nbsp;215]</a></span>
and if I release thee now he will rightly call me a traitor.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ah, Adam! thou wilt find him a false rogue at the last,
as I have done. Release me, dear friend Adam, and I
will be true to my agreement, and will keep my covenant
to share my land with thee.&rdquo; By these earnest words
the steward was persuaded, and, waiting till Sir John
was safely in bed, managed to obtain possession of the
keys and release Gamelyn, who stretched his arms and
legs and thanked God for his liberty. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;if I were but well fed no one in this house should
bind me again to-night.&rdquo; So Adam took him to a
private room and set food before him; eagerly he
ate and drank till his hunger was satisfied and he began
to think of revenge. &ldquo;What is your advice, Adam?
Shall I go to my brother and strike off his head? He
well merits it.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>A Plan of Escape</h3>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Adam, &ldquo;I know a better plan than
that. Sir John is to give a great feast on Sunday to
many Churchmen and prelates; there will be present a
great number of abbots and priors and other holy men.
Do you stand as if bound by your post in the hall, and
beseech them to release you. If they will be surety for
you, your liberty will be gained with no blame to me; if
they all refuse, you shall cast aside the unlocked chains,
and you and I, with two good staves, can soon win your
freedom. Christ&rsquo;s curse on him who fails his comrade!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; quoth Gamelyn, &ldquo;evil may I thrive if I fail
in my part of the bargain! But if we must needs help
them to do penance for their sins, you must warn me,
brother Adam, when to begin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By St. Charity, master, I will give you good
warning. When I wink at you be ready to cast away
your fetters at once and come to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg&nbsp;216]</a></span>
&ldquo;This is good advice of yours, Adam, and blessings
on your head. If these haughty Churchmen refuse
to be surety for me I will give them good strokes in
payment.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>A Great Feast</h3>

<p>Sunday came, and after mass many guests thronged
to the feast in the great hall; they all stared curiously
at Gamelyn as he stood with his hands behind him,
apparently chained to his post, and Sir John explained
sadly that he, after slaying the porter and wasting the
household stores, had gone mad, and was obliged to be
chained, for his fury was dangerous. The servants
carried dainty dishes round the table, and beakers of
rich wines, but though Gamelyn cried aloud that he
was fasting no food was brought to him. Then he
spoke pitifully and humbly to the noble guests:
&ldquo;Lords, for Christ&rsquo;s sake help a poor captive out of
prison.&rdquo; But the guests were hard-hearted, and answered
cruelly, especially the abbots and priors, who had been
deceived by Sir John&rsquo;s false tales. So harshly did they
reply to the youth&rsquo;s humble petition that he grew angry.
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that is all the answer I am to have to
my prayer! Now I see that I have no friends. Cursed
be he that ever does good to abbot or prior!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 412px;">
<img src="images/hmlbr32.jpg" width="412" height="600" alt="" />
<a name="image_page_214" id="image_page_214"></a>
</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;Lords, for Christ&rsquo;s sake help poor Gamelyn out of prison!&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The Banquet Disturbed</h3>

<p>Adam Spencer, busied about the removal of the cloth,
looked anxiously at Gamelyn, and saw how angry he
grew. He thought little more of his service, but, making
a pretext to go to the pantry, brought two good oak staves,
and stood them beside the hall door. Then he winked
meaningly at Gamelyn, who with a sudden shout flung
off his chains, rushed to the hall door, seized a staff,
and began to lay about him lustily, whirling his weapon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg&nbsp;217]</a></span>
as lightly as if it had been a holy water sprinkler.
There was a dreadful commotion in the hall, for the
portly Churchmen tried to escape, but the mere laymen
loved Gamelyn, and drew aside to give him free play,
so that he was able to scatter the prelates. Now he
had no pity on these cruel Churchmen, as they had been
without pity for him; he knocked them over, battered
them, broke their arms and legs, and wrought terrible
havoc among them; and during this time Adam
Spencer kept the door so that none might escape.
He called aloud to Gamelyn to respect the sanctity
of men of Holy Church and shed no blood, but if he
should by chance break arms and legs there would be
no sacrilege, because no blood need be shed.</p>


<h3>Sir John in Chains</h3>

<p>Thus Gamelyn worked his will, laying hands on
monks and friars, and sent them home wounded in
carts and waggons, while some of them muttered:
&ldquo;We were better at home, with mere bread and water,
than here where we have had such a sorry feast!&rdquo; Then
Gamelyn turned his attention to his false brother, who
had been unable to escape, seized him by the neck,
broke his backbone with one blow from his staff, and
thrust him, sitting, into the fetters that yet hung from
the post where Gamelyn had stood. &ldquo;Sit there, brother,
and cool thy blood,&rdquo; said Gamelyn, as he and Adam
sat down to a feast, at which the servants waited on
them eagerly, partly from love and partly from fear.</p>


<h3>The Sheriff&rsquo;s Men Appear</h3>

<p>Now the sheriff happened to be only five miles away,
and soon heard the news of this disturbance, and how
Gamelyn and Adam had broken the king&rsquo;s peace; and,
as his duty was, he determined to arrest the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg&nbsp;218]</a></span>
law-breakers. Twenty-four of his best men were sent to
the castle to gain admittance and arrest Gamelyn and
his steward; but the new porter, a devoted adherent
of Gamelyn, denied them entrance till he knew their
errand; when they refused to tell it, he sent a servant
to rouse Gamelyn and warn him that the sheriff&rsquo;s
men stood before the gate.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Then answered Gamelyn: &lsquo;Good porter, go;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Delay my foes with fair speech at the gate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till I relieve thee with some cunning wile.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I o&rsquo;erlive this strait, I will requite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy truth and loyalty. Adam,&rsquo; quoth he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Our foes are on us, and we have no friend&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sheriff&rsquo;s men surround us, and have sworn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mighty oath to take us: we must go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whither our safety calls us.&rsquo; He replied:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Go where thou wilt, I follow to the last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or die forlorn: but this proud sheriffs troop<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will flee before our onset, to the fens.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>


<h3>The Sheriff Arrives</h3>

<p>As Gamelyn and Adam looked round for weapons
the former saw a cart-staff, a stout post used for propping
up the shafts; this he seized, and ran out at the
little postern gate, followed by Adam with another
staff. They caught the sheriff&rsquo;s twenty-four bold men
in the rear, and when Gamelyn had felled three, and
Adam two, the rest took to their heels. &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said
Adam as they fled. &ldquo;Drink a draught of my good wine!
I am steward here.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; they shouted back; &ldquo;such
wine as yours scatters a man&rsquo;s brains far too thoroughly.&rdquo;
Now this little fray was hardly ended before the sheriff
came in person with a great troop. Gamelyn knew not
what to do, but Adam again had a plan ready. &ldquo;Let us
stay no longer, but go to the greenwood: there we shall
at least be at liberty.&rdquo; The advice suited Gamelyn, and
each drank a draught of wine, mounted his steed, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg&nbsp;219]</a></span>
lightly rode away, leaving the empty nest for the sheriff,
with no eggs therein. However, that officer dismounted,
entered the hall, and found Sir John fettered and nearly
dying. He released him, and summoned a leech, who
healed his grievous wound, and enabled him to do more
mischief.</p>


<h3>Gamelyn Goes to the Greenwood</h3>

<p>Meanwhile Adam wandered with Gamelyn in the
greenwood, and found it very hard work, with little
food. He complained aloud to his young lord:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Would I were back in mine old stewardship&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full blithe were I, the keys to bear and keep!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I like not this wild wood, with wounding thorns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nought of food or drink, or restful ease.&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Ah! Adam,&rsquo; answered Gamelyn, &lsquo;in sooth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full many a good man&rsquo;s son feels bitter woe!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then cheer thee, Adam.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 407px;">
<img src="images/hmlbr33.jpg" width="407" height="600" alt="" />
<a name="image_page_218" id="image_page_218"></a>
</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;Then cheer thee, Adam&rdquo;</p>

<p>As they spoke sadly together Gamelyn heard men&rsquo;s
voices near by, and, looking through the bushes, saw
seven score young men, sitting round a plentiful feast,
spread on the green grass. He rejoiced greatly, bidding
Adam remember that &ldquo;Boot cometh after bale,&rdquo; and
pointing out to him the abundance of provisions near
at hand. Adam longed for a good meal, for they had
found little to eat since they came to the greenwood.
At that moment the master-outlaw saw them in the
underwood, and bade his young men bring to him
these new guests whom God had sent: perchance, he
said, there were others besides these two. The seven
bold youths who started up to do his will cried to
the two new-comers: &ldquo;Yield and hand us your bows
and arrows!&rdquo; &ldquo;Much sorrow may he have who yields
to you,&rdquo; cried Gamelyn. &ldquo;Why, with five more ye would
be only twelve, and I could fight you all.&rdquo; When the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg&nbsp;220]</a></span>
outlaws saw how boldly he bore himself they changed
their tone, and said mildly: &ldquo;Come to our master, and
tell him thy desire.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who is your master?&rdquo; quoth
Gamelyn. &ldquo;He is the crowned king of the outlaws,&rdquo;
quoth they; and the two strangers were led away to the
chief.</p>

<p>The master-outlaw, sitting on a rustic throne, with
a crown of oak-leaves on his head, asked them their
business, and Gamelyn replied: &ldquo;He must needs walk
in the wood who may not walk in the town. We are
hungry and faint, and will only shoot the deer for food,
for we are hard bestead and in great danger.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>Gamelyn Joins the Outlaws</h3>

<p>The outlaw leader had pity on their distress, and
gave them food; and as they ate ravenously the outlaws
whispered one to another: &ldquo;This is Gamelyn!&rdquo;
&ldquo;This is Gamelyn!&rdquo; Understanding all the evils
that had befallen him, their leader soon made Gamelyn
his second in command; and when after three weeks the
outlaw king was pardoned and allowed to return home,
Gamelyn was chosen to succeed him and was crowned
king of the outlaws. So he dwelt merrily in the forest,
and troubled not himself about the world outside.</p>


<h3>The Law at Work</h3>

<p>Meanwhile the treacherous Sir John had recovered,
and in due course had become sheriff, and indicted his
brother for felony. As Gamelyn did not appear to
answer the indictment he was proclaimed an outlaw
and wolf&rsquo;s-head, and a price was set upon his life.
Now his bondmen and vassals were grieved at this, for
they feared the cruelty of the wicked sheriff; they
therefore sent messengers to Gamelyn to tell him the
ill news, and deprecate his wrath. The youth&rsquo;s anger
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg&nbsp;221]</a></span>
rose at the tidings, and he promised to come and beard
Sir John in his hall and protect his own tenants.</p>


<h3>Gamelyn Arrested</h3>

<p>It was certainly a stroke of rash daring thus to venture
into the county where his brother was sheriff, but
he strode boldly into the moot-hall, with his hood
thrown back, so that all might recognise him, and cried
aloud: &ldquo;God save all you lordings here present! But,
thou broken-backed sheriff, evil mayst thou thrive!
Why hast thou done me such wrong and disgrace as
to have me indicted and proclaimed an outlaw?&rdquo;
Sir John did not hesitate to use his legal powers, but,
seeing his brother was quite alone, had him arrested
and cast into prison, whence it was his intention that
only death should release him.</p>


<h3>Otho as Surety</h3>

<p>All these years the second brother, Otho, had lived
quietly on his own lands and taken no heed of the
quarrels of the two others; but now, when news came
to him of Sir John&rsquo;s deadly hatred to their youngest
brother, and Gamelyn&rsquo;s desperate plight, he was deeply
grieved, roused himself from his peaceful life, and rode
to see if he could help his brother. First he besought
Sir John&rsquo;s mercy for the prisoner, for the sake of
brotherhood and family love; but he only replied
that Gamelyn must stay imprisoned till the justice
should hold the next assize. Then Otho offered to be
bail, if only his young brother might be released from his
bonds and brought from the dismal dungeon where he
lay. To this Sir John finally consented, warning Otho
that if the accused failed to appear before the justice
he himself must suffer the penalty for the breach
of bail. &ldquo;I agree,&rdquo; said Otho. &ldquo;Have him released at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg&nbsp;222]</a></span>
once, and deliver him to me.&rdquo; Then Gamelyn was set
free on his brother&rsquo;s surety, and the two rode home
to Otho&rsquo;s house, talking sadly of all that had befallen,
and how Gamelyn had become king of the outlaws.
The next morning Gamelyn asked Otho&rsquo;s permission to
go to the greenwood and see how his young men fared
but Otho pointed out so clearly how dreadful would
be the consequences to him if he did not return that
the young man vowed:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;I swear by James, the mighty saint of Spain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I will not desert thee, nor will fail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To stand my trial on the appointed day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If God Almighty give me strength and health<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And power to keep my vow. I will be there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I may show what bitter hate Sir John,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My cruel brother, holds against me.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>


<h3>Gamelyn Goes to the Woods</h3>

<p>Thereupon Otho bade him go. &ldquo;God shield thee
from shame! Come when thou seest it is the right
time, and save us both from blame and reproach.&rdquo; So
Gamelyn went gaily to the merry greenwood, and found
his company of outlaws; and so much had they to tell
of their work in his absence, and so much had he to
relate of his adventures, that time slipped by, and
he soon fell again into his former mode of life, and
his custom of robbing none but Churchmen, fat abbots
and priors, monks and canons, so that all others spoke
good of him, and called him the &ldquo;courteous outlaw.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The Term Expires</h3>

<p>Gamelyn stood one day looking out over the woods
and fields, and it suddenly came to his mind with a
pang of self-reproach that he had forgotten his promise
to Otho, and the day of the assize was very near. He
called his young men (for he had learned not to trust
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg&nbsp;223]</a></span>
himself to the honour or loyalty of his brother the
sheriff), and bade them prepare to accompany him to
the place of assize, sending Adam on as a scout to learn
tidings. Adam returned in great haste, bringing sad
news. The judge was in his place, a jury empanelled
to condemn Gamelyn to death, bribed thereto by the
wicked sheriff, and Otho was fettered in the gaol in
place of his brother. The news enraged Gamelyn, but
Adam Spencer was even more infuriated; he would
gladly have held the doors of the moot-hall and slain
every person inside except Otho; but his master&rsquo;s sense
of justice was too strong for that. &ldquo;Adam,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;we will not do so, but will slay the guilty and let the
innocent escape. I myself will have some conversation
with the justice in the hall; and meanwhile do ye, my
men, hold the doors fast. I will make myself justice to-day,
and thou, Adam, shalt be my clerk. We will give sentence
this day, and God speed our new work!&rdquo; All his
men applauded this speech and promised him obedience,
and the troop of outlaws hastened to surround the hall.</p>


<h3>Gamelyn in the Court</h3>

<p>Once again Gamelyn strode into the moot-hall in
the midst of his enemies, and was recognised by all.
He released Otho, who said gently: &ldquo;Brother, thou
hast nearly overstayed the time; the sentence has been
given against me that I shall be hanged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said Gamelyn, &ldquo;this day shall thy foes and
mine be hanged: the sheriff, the justice, and the wicked
jurors.&rdquo; Then Gamelyn turned to the judge, who sat as
if paralysed in his seat of judgment, and said:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Come from the seat of justice: all too oft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hast thou polluted law&rsquo;s clear stream with wrong;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too oft hast taken reward against the poor;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too oft hast lent thine aid to villainy,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg&nbsp;224]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And given judgment &rsquo;gainst the innocent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come down and meet thine own meed at the bar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While I, in thy place, give more rightful doom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And see that justice dwells in law for once.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>

</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;Come from the seat of justice&rdquo;</p>


<h3>A Scene</h3>

<p>The justice sat still, dumb with astonishment, and
Gamelyn struck him fiercely, cut his cheek, and threw
him over the bar so that his arm broke; and no man
durst withstand the outlaw, for fear of his company
standing at the doors. The youth sat down in the
judge&rsquo;s seat, with Otho beside him, and Adam in the
clerk&rsquo;s desk; and he placed in the dock the false
sheriff, the justice, and the unjust jurors, and accused
them of wrong and attempted murder. In order to
keep up the forms of law, he empanelled a jury of
his own young men, who brought in a verdict of
&ldquo;Guilty,&rdquo; and the prisoners were all condemned to
death and hanged out of hand, though the false sheriff
attempted to appeal to the brotherly affection of which
he had shown so little.</p>


<h3>Honour from the King</h3>

<p>After this high-handed punishment of their enemies
Gamelyn and his brother went to lay their case before
King Edward, and he forgave them, in consideration of
all the wrongs and injuries Gamelyn had suffered; and
before they returned to their distant county the king
made Otho sheriff of the county, and Gamelyn chief
forester of all his free forests; his band of outlaws
were all pardoned, and the king gave them posts
according to their capabilities. Now Gamelyn and his
brother settled down to a happy, peaceful life. Otho,
having no son, made Gamelyn his heir, and the latter
married a beauteous lady, and lived with her in joy till
his life&rsquo;s end.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI: WILLIAM OF
CLOUDESLEE</h2>


<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE outlaw of medi&aelig;val England has always
possessed a potent charm for the minds of less
rebellious persons. No doubt now the attraction
has somewhat waned, for in the exploration of
distant lands and the study of barbaric tribes men can
find that breadth of outlook, that escape from narrow
conventionalities, which they could formerly gain only
by the cult of the &ldquo;noble outlaw.&rdquo; The romance of
life for many a worthy citizen must have been found
in secret sympathy with Robin Hood and his merry
band of banished men, robbing the purse-proud to help
the needy and gaily defying law and authority.</p>

<p>To the poor, however, the outlaw was something
more than an easy entrance to the realms of romance;
he was a real embodiment of the spirit of liberty. Of
all the unjust laws which the Norman conquerors laid
upon England, perhaps the most bitterly resented were
the forest laws, and resistance to them was the most
popular form of national independence. Hence it
follows that we find outlaw heroes popular very early
in our history&mdash;heroes who stand in the mind of the
populace for justice and true liberty against the oppressive
tyranny of subordinate officials, and who are always
taken into favour by the king, the fount of true justice.</p>


<h3>Famous Outlaws</h3>

<p>There is some slight tinge of the &ldquo;outlaw hero&rdquo; in
Hereward, but the outlaw period of that patriot&rsquo;s life
is but an episode in his defence of England against
William the Norman. There is a fully developed outlaw
hero, the ideal of the type, in Robin Hood, but he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg&nbsp;226]</a></span>
has been somewhat idealized and ennobled by being
transformed into a banished Earl of Huntingdon. Less
known, but equally heroic, is William of Cloudeslee,
the William Tell of England, whose fame is that of a
good yeoman, a good archer, and a good patriot.</p>


<h3>The Outlaws</h3>

<p>In the green forest of Englewood, in the &ldquo;North
Countree,&rdquo; not far from the fortified town of Carlisle,
dwelt a merry band of outlaws. They were not evildoers,
but sturdy archers and yeomen, whose outlawry
had been incurred only for shooting the king&rsquo;s deer.
Indeed, to most men of that time&mdash;that is, to most men
who were not in the royal service&mdash;the shooting of deer,
and the pursuit of game in general, were not only
venial offences, but the most natural thing in life. The
royal claim to exclusive hunting in the vast forests of
Epping, Sherwood, Needwood, Barnesdale, Englewood,
and many others seemed preposterous to the yeomen
who lived on the borders of the forests, and they took
their risks and shot the deer and made venison pasty,
convinced that they were wronging no one and risking
only their own lives. They had the help and sympathy
of many a man who was himself a law-abiding citizen,
as well as the less understanding help of the town mob
and the labourers in the country.</p>


<h3>The Leaders</h3>

<p>While the outlaws of merry Sherwood recognised no
chief but Robin Hood and no foe but the Sheriff of
Nottingham, the outlaws of Englewood were under
the headship of three famous archers, brothers-in-arms
sworn to stand by each other, but not brothers in blood.
Their names were Adam Bell, William of Cloudeslee,
and Clym of the Cleugh; and of the three William of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg&nbsp;227]</a></span>
Cloudeslee alone was married. His wife, fair Alice of
Cloudeslee, dwelt in a strong house within the walls
of Carlisle, with her three children, for they were not
included in William&rsquo;s outlawry. It was possible thus
for her to send her husband warning of any attack
planned by the Sheriff of Carlisle on the outlaws, and she
had saved him and his comrades from surprise already.</p>


<h3>William Goes to Carlisle</h3>

<p>When the blithe spring had come, and the forest was
beautiful with its fresh green leaves, William began to
long for his home and family; he had not ventured
into Carlisle for some time, and it was more than six
months since he had seen his wife&rsquo;s face. Little wonder
was it, then, that he announced his intention of visiting
his home, at the risk of capture by his old enemy the
Sheriff. In vain his comrades dissuaded him from the
venture. Adam Bell was especially urgent in his advice
that William should remain in the greenwood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall not go to Carlisle, brother, by my advice,
nor with my consent. If the sheriff or the justice
should know that you are in the town short would be
your shrift and soon your span of life would end. Stay
with us, and we will fetch you tidings of your wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>William replied: &ldquo;Nay, I must go myself; I cannot
rest content with tidings only. If all is well I will
return by prime to-morrow, and if I fail you at that
hour you may be sure I am taken or slain; and I pray
you guard well my family, if that be so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taking leave of his brother outlaws, William made
his way unobserved into the town and came to his wife&rsquo;s
dwelling. It was closely shut, with doors strongly
bolted, and he was forced to knock long on the window
before his wife opened the shutter to see who was the
importunate visitor.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg&nbsp;228]</a></span>
&ldquo;Let me in quickly, my own Alice,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have
come to see you and my three children. How have
you fared this long time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; she replied, hurriedly admitting him, and
bolting the door again, &ldquo;why have you come now,
risking your dear life to gain news of us? Know you
not that this house has been watched for more than six
months, so eager are the sheriff and the justice to
capture and hang you? I would have come to you in
the forest, or sent you word of our welfare. I fear&mdash;oh,
how I fear!&mdash;lest your coming be known!&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The Old Woman&rsquo;s Treachery</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Now that I am here, let us make merry,&rdquo; quoth
William. &ldquo;No man has seen me enter, and I would
fain enjoy my short stay with you and my children, for
I must be back in the forest by prime to-morrow. Can
you not give a hungry outlaw food and drink?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Dame Alice bustled about and prepared the
best she had for her husband; and when all was ready
a very happy little family sat down to the meal,
husband and wife talking cheerily together, while the
children watched in wondering silence the father who
had been away so long and came to them so seldom.</p>

<p>There was one inmate of the house who saw in
William&rsquo;s return a means of making shameful profit.
She was an old bedridden woman, apparently paralysed,
whom he had rescued from utter poverty seven years
before. During all that time she had lain on a bed
near the fire, had shared all the life of the family, and
had never once moved from her couch. Now, while
husband and wife talked together and the darkness
deepened in the room, this old impostor slipped from
her bed and glided stealthily out of the house.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg&nbsp;229]</a></span></p>

<h3>News Brought to the Sheriff</h3>

<p>It happened that the king&rsquo;s assize was being held
just then in Carlisle, and the sheriff and his staunch
ally the justice were sitting together in the Justice
Hall. Thither this treacherous old woman hurried
with all speed and pushed into the hall, forcing her
way through the crowd till she came near the sheriff.
&ldquo;Ha! what would you, good woman?&rdquo; asked he,
surprised. &ldquo;Sir, I bring tidings of great value.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Tell your tidings, and I shall see if they be of value
or no. If they are I will reward you handsomely.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Sir, this night William of Cloudeslee has come into
Carlisle, and is even now in his wife&rsquo;s house. He is
all alone, and you can take him easily. Now what will
you pay me, for I am sure this news is much to you?&rdquo;
&ldquo;You say truth, good woman. That bold outlaw is
the worst of all who kill the king&rsquo;s deer in his forest of
Englewood, and if I could but catch him I should be
well content. Dame, you shall not go without a
recompense for your journey here and for your
loyalty.&rdquo; The sheriff then bade his men give the
old woman a piece of scarlet cloth, dyed in grain,
enough for a gown, and the treacherous hag hid the
gift under her cloak, hastened away to Alice&rsquo;s house,
and slipped unperceived into her place again, hiding the
scarlet cloth under the bed-coverings.</p>


<h3>The Hue and Cry</h3>

<p>Immediately he had heard of Cloudeslee&rsquo;s presence
in Carlisle the sheriff sent out the hue and cry, and
with all speed raised the whole town, for though none
hated the outlaws men dared not refuse to obey the
king&rsquo;s officer. The justice, too, joined the sheriff
in the congenial task of capturing an outlaw whose
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg&nbsp;230]</a></span>
condemnation was already pronounced. With all the
forces at their disposal, sheriff and justice took their
way towards the house where William and Alice
unconscious of the danger besetting them, still talked
lovingly together.</p>

<p>Suddenly the outlaw&rsquo;s ears, sharpened by woodcraft
and by constant danger, heard a growing noise
coming nearer and nearer. He knew the sound of
the footsteps of many people, and among the casual
shuffling of feet recognised the ominous tramp of
soldiers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wife, we are betrayed,&rdquo; cried William. &ldquo;Hither
comes the sheriff to take me.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The Siege of the House</h3>

<p>Alice ran quickly up to her bedchamber and opened
a window looking to the back, and saw, to her despair,
that soldiers beset the house on every side and filled all
the neighbouring streets. Behind them pressed a great
throng of citizens, who seemed inclined to leave the
capture of the outlaw to the guard. At the same
moment William from the front called to his wife that
the sheriff and justice were besieging the house on
that side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas! dear husband, what shall we do?&rdquo; cried
Alice. &ldquo;Accursed be all treason! But who can have
betrayed you to your foes? Go into my bedchamber,
dear William, and defend yourself there, for it is the
strongest room in the house. The children and I will
go with you, and I will guard the door while you
defend the windows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The plan was speedily carried out, and while William
took his stand by the window Alice seized a pole-axe
and stationed herself by the door. &ldquo;No man shall
enter this door alive while I live,&rdquo; said she.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg&nbsp;231]</a></span></p>

<h3>The Attack</h3>

<p>From the window Cloudeslee could perceive his
mortal enemies the justice and the sheriff; and drawing
his good longbow, he shot with deadly aim fair at
the breast of the justice. It was well for the latter
then that he wore a suit of good chain-mail under his
robes; the arrow hit his breast and split in three on the
mail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beshrew the man that clad you with that mail
coat! You would have been a dead man now if your
coat had been no thicker than mine,&rdquo; said William.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yield yourself, Cloudeslee, and lay down your bow
and arrows,&rdquo; said the justice. &ldquo;You cannot escape, for
we have you safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never shall my husband yield; it is evil counsel
you give,&rdquo; exclaimed the brave wife from her post at
the door.</p>


<h3>The House is Burnt</h3>

<p>The sheriff, who grew more angered as the hours
passed on and Cloudeslee was not taken, now cried
aloud: &ldquo;Why do we waste time trifling here? The
man is an outlaw and his life is forfeit. Let us burn
him and his house, and if his wife and children will
not leave him they shall all burn together, for it is
their own choice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This cruel plan was soon carried out. Fire was set
to the door and wooden shutters, and the flames spread
swiftly; the smoke rolled up in thick clouds into the
lofty bedchamber, where the little children, crouching
on the ground, began to weep for fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas! must we all die?&rdquo; cried fair Alice, grieving
for her children.</p>

<p>William opened the window and looked out, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg&nbsp;232]</a></span>
there was no chance of escape; his foes filled every
street and lane around the house. &ldquo;Surely they will
spare my wife and babes,&rdquo; he thought; and, tearing the
sheets from the bed, he made a rope, with which he let
down to the ground his children, and last of all his
weeping wife.</p>

<p>He called aloud to the sheriff: &ldquo;Sir Sheriff, here have
I trusted to you my chief treasures. For God&rsquo;s sake do
them no harm, but wreak all your wrath on me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gentle hands received Alice and her babes, and
friendly citizens led them from the press; but Alice went
reluctantly, in utter grief, knowing that her husband
must be burnt with his house or taken by his foes; but
for her children she would have stayed with him.
William continued his wonderful archery, never missing
his aim, till all his arrows were spent, and the flames
came so close that his bowstring was burnt in two. Great
blazing brands came falling upon him from the burning
roof, and the floor was hot beneath his feet. &ldquo;An evil
death is this!&rdquo; thought he. &ldquo;Better it were that I should
take sword and buckler and leap down amid my foes
and so die, striking good blows in the throng of enemies,
than stay here and let them see me burn.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 416px;">
<img src="images/hmlbr35.jpg" width="416" height="600" alt="" />
<a name="image_page_232" id="image_page_232"></a>
</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;William continued his wonderful archery&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thereupon he leaped lightly down, and fought so
fiercely that he nearly escaped through the throng, for
the worthy citizens of Carlisle were not anxious to
capture him; but the soldiers, urged by the sheriff and
justice, threw doors and windows upon him, hampered
his blows, and seized and bound him, and cast him into
a deep dungeon.</p>


<h3>The Sheriff Gives Sentence</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Now, William of Cloudeslee,&rdquo; quoth the sheriff,
&ldquo;you shall be hanged with speed, as soon as I can have
a new gallows made. So noted an outlaw merits no
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg&nbsp;233]</a></span>
common gibbet; a new one is most fitting. To-morrow
at prime you shall die. There is no hope of rescue, for
the gates of the town shall be shut. Your dear friends,
Adam Bell and Clym of the Cleugh, would be helpless
to save you, though they brought a thousand more like
themselves, or even all the devils in Hell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Early next morning the justice arose, went to the
soldiers who guarded the gates, and forbade them to
open till the execution was over; then he went to the
market-place and superintended the erection of a specially
lofty gallows, beside the pillory.</p>


<h3>News is Brought to the Greenwood</h3>

<p>Among the crowd who watched the gallows being
raised was a little lad, the town swineherd, who asked
a bystander the meaning of the new gibbet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is put up to hang a good yeoman, William of
Cloudeslee, more&rsquo;s the pity! He has done no wrong
but kill the King&rsquo;s deer, and that merits not hanging.
It is a foul shame that such injustice can be wrought in
the king&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little lad had often met William of Cloudeslee
in the forest, and had carried him messages from his
wife; William had given the boy many a dinner of
venison, and now he determined to help his friend if he
could. The gates were shut and no man could pass
out, but the boy stole along the wall till he found a
crevice, by which he clambered down outside. Then he
hastened to the forest of Englewood, and met Adam
Bell and Clym of the Cleugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come quickly, good yeomen; ye tarry here too long.
While you are at ease in the greenwood your friend,
William of Cloudeslee, is taken, condemned to death, and
ready to be hanged. He needs your help this very hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Adam Bell groaned. &ldquo;Ah! if he had but taken our
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg&nbsp;234]</a></span>
advice he would have been here in safety with us now.
In the greenwood there is no sorrow or care, but when
William went to the town he was running into trouble.&rdquo;
Then, bending his bow, he shot with unerring aim a
hart, which he gave to the lad as recompense for his
labour and goodwill.</p>


<h3>The Outlaws Go to Carlisle</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Clym to Adam Bell, &ldquo;let us tarry no
longer, but take our bows and arrows and see what we
can do. By God&rsquo;s grace we will rescue our brother,
though we may abide it full dearly ourselves. We will
go to Carlisle without delay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The morning was fair as the two yeomen strode from
the deep green shades of Englewood Forest along the
hard white road leading to Carlisle Town. They were
in time as yet, but when they drew near the wall they
were amazed to see that no entrance or exit was possible;
the gates were shut fast.</p>

<p>Stepping back into the green thickets beside the road,
the two outlaws consulted together. Adam Bell was
for a valiant attempt to storm the gate, but Clym suddenly
bethought him of a wiser plan.</p>


<h3>Clym&rsquo;s Stratagem</h3>

<p>Said he: &ldquo;Let us pretend to be messengers from the
king, with urgent letters to the justice. Surely that
should win us admission. But alas! I forgot. How
can we bear out our pretence, for I am no learned clerk.
I cannot write.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Quoth Adam Bell: &ldquo;I can write a good clerkly hand.
Wait one instant and I will speedily have a letter written;
then we can say we have the king&rsquo;s seal. The plan will
do well enough, for I hold the gate-keeper no learned
clerk, and this will deceive him.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 418px;">
<img src="images/hmlbr36.jpg" width="418" height="600" alt="" />
<a name="image_page_234" id="image_page_234"></a>
</div>

<p class="caption">Adam Bell writes the letter</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg&nbsp;235]</a></span>
Indeed, the letter which he quickly wrote and folded
and sealed was very well and clearly written, and addressed
to the Justice of Carlisle. Then the two bold
outlaws hastened up the road and thundered on the
town gates.</p>


<h3>They Enter the Town</h3>

<p>So long and loud they knocked that the warder came
in great wrath, demanding who dared to make such
clamour.</p>

<p>Adam Bell replied: &ldquo;We are two messengers come
straight from our lord the king.&rdquo; Clym of the Cleugh
added: &ldquo;We have a letter for the justice which we
must deliver into his own hands. Let us in speedily to
perform our errand, for we must return to the king in
haste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the warder replied, &ldquo;that I cannot do. No
man may enter these gates till a false thief and outlaw be
safely hanged. He is William of Cloudeslee, who has
long deserved death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now Clym saw that matters were becoming desperate,
and time was passing too quickly, so he adopted a more
violent tone. &ldquo;Ah, rascal, scoundrel, madman!&rdquo; quoth
he. &ldquo;If we be delayed here any longer thou shalt be
hanged for a false thief! To keep the king&rsquo;s messengers
waiting thus! Canst thou not see the king&rsquo;s seal?
Canst thou not read the address of the royal letter?
Ah, blockhead, thou shalt dearly abide this delay when
my lord knows thereof.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus speaking, he flourished the forged letter, with
its false seal, in the porter&rsquo;s face; and the man, seeing
the seal and the writing, believed what was told him.
Reverently he took off his hood and bent the knee to
the king&rsquo;s messengers, for whom he opened wide the
gates, and they entered, walking warily.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg&nbsp;236]</a></span></p>

<h3>They Keep the Gates</h3>

<p>&ldquo;At last we are within Carlisle walls, and glad thereof
are we,&rdquo; said Adam Bell, &ldquo;but when and how we shall
go out again Christ only knows, who harrowed Hell
and brought out its prisoners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now if we had the keys ourselves we should have
a good chance of life,&rdquo; said Clym, &ldquo;for then we could
go in and out at our own will.&rdquo; &ldquo;Let us call the
warder,&rdquo; said Adam. When he came running at their
call both the yeomen sprang upon him, flung him to
the ground, bound him hand and foot, and cast him
into a dark cell, taking his bunch of keys from his
girdle. Adam laughed and shook the heavy keys.
&ldquo;Now I am gate-ward of merry Carlisle. See, here
are my keys. I think I shall be the worst warder they
have had for three hundred years. Let us bend our
bows and hold our arrows ready, and walk into the
town to deliver our brother.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The Fight in the Market-place</h3>

<p>When they came to the market-place they found a
dense crowd of sympathizers watching pityingly the
hangman&rsquo;s cart, in which lay William of Cloudeslee,
bound hand and foot, with a rope round his neck.
The sheriff and the justice stood near the gallows, and
Cloudeslee would have been hanged already, but that
the sheriff was hiring a man to measure the outlaw for
his grave. &ldquo;You shall have the dead man&rsquo;s clothes,
good fellow, if you make his grave,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>Cloudeslee&rsquo;s courage was still undaunted. &ldquo;I have
seen as great a marvel ere now,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;as that a
man who digs a grave for another may lie in it himself,
in as short a time as from now to prime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You speak proudly, my fine fellow, but hanged you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg&nbsp;237]</a></span>
shall be, if I do it with my own hand,&rdquo; retorted the
sheriff furiously.</p>

<p>Now the cart moved a little nearer to the scaffold, and
William was raised up to be ready for execution. As
he looked round the dense mass of faces his keen sight
soon made him aware of his friends. Adam Bell and
Clym of the Cleugh stood at one corner of the market-place
with arrow on string, and their deadly aim bent
at the sheriff and justice, whose horses raised them
high above the murmuring throng. Cloudeslee showed
no surprise, but said aloud: &ldquo;Lo! I see comfort, and
hope to fare well in my journey. Yet if I might have
my hands free I would care little what else befell me.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The Rescue</h3>

<p>Now Adam said quietly to Clym: &ldquo;Brother, do you
take the justice, and I will shoot the sheriff. Let us
both loose at once and leave them dying. It is an
easy shot, though a long one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus, while the sheriff yet waited for William to be
measured for his grave, suddenly men heard the twang
of bowstrings and the whistling flight of arrows through
the air, and at the same moment both sheriff and
justice fell writhing from their steeds, with the grey
goose feathers standing in their breasts. All the bystanders
fled from the dangerous neighbourhood, and left
the gallows, the fatal cart, and the mortally wounded
officials alone. The two bold outlaws rushed to release
their comrade, cut his bonds, and lifted him to his feet.
William seized an axe from a soldier and pursued the
fleeing guard, while his two friends with their deadly
arrows slew a man at each shot.</p>


<h3>The Mayor of Carlisle</h3>

<p>When the arrows were all used Adam Bell and Clym
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg&nbsp;238]</a></span>
of the Cleugh threw away their bows and took to
sword and buckler. The fight continued till midday
for in the narrow streets the three comrades protected
each other, and drew gradually towards the gate. Adam
Bell still carried the keys at his girdle, and they could
pass out easily if they could but once reach the gateway.
By this time the whole town was in a commotion; again
the hue and cry had been raised against the outlaws, and
the Mayor of Carlisle came in person with a mighty
troop of armed citizens, angered now at the fighting in
the streets of the town.</p>

<p>The three yeomen retreated as steadily as they could
towards the gate, but the mayor followed valiantly
armed with a pole-axe, with which he clove Cloudeslee&rsquo;s
shield in two. He soon perceived the object of the
outlaws, and bade his men guard the gates well, so that
the three should not escape.</p>


<h3>The Escape from Carlisle</h3>

<p>Terrible was the din in the town now, for trumpets
blew, church-bells were rung backward, women bewailed
their dead in the streets, and over all resounded the
clash of arms, as the fighting drew nigh the gate. When
the gatehouse came in sight the outlaws were fighting
desperately, with diminishing strength, but the thought
of safety outside the walls gave them force to make one
last stand. With backs to the gate and faces to the
foe, Adam and Clym and William made a valiant
onslaught on the townsfolk, who fled in terror, leaving
a breathing-space in which Adam Bell turned the key,
flung open the great ponderous gate, and flung it to
again, when the three had passed through.</p>

<a name="image_page_238" id="image_page_238"></a>
</div>

<p class="caption">The fight at the gate</p>


<h3>Adam and the Keys</h3>

<p>As Adam locked the door they could hear inside
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg&nbsp;239]</a></span>
the town the hurrying footsteps of the rallying citizens,
whose furious attack on the great iron-studded door
came too late. The door was locked, and the three
friends stood in safety outside, with their pleasant
forest home within easy reach. The change of feeling
was so intense that Adam Bell, always the man to seize
the humorous point of a situation, laughed lightly.
He called through the barred wicket:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here are your keys. I resign my office as warder&mdash;one
half-day&rsquo;s work is enough for me; and as I
have resigned, and the former gate-ward is somewhat
damaged and has disappeared, I advise you to find a
new one. Take your keys, and much good may you
get from them. Next time I advise you not to stop an
honest yeoman from coming to see his own wife and
have a chat with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thereupon he flung the keys over the gate on the
heads of the crowd, and the three brethren slipped
away into the forest to their own haunts, where they
found fresh bows and arrows in such abundance that
they longed to be back in fair Carlisle with their foes
before them.</p>


<h3>William of Cloudeslee and his Wife Meet</h3>

<p>While they were yet discussing all the details of the
rescue they heard a woman&rsquo;s pitiful lament and the
crying of little children. &ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; said Cloudeslee,
and they all heard in the silence the words she said.
It was William&rsquo;s wife, and she cried: &ldquo;Alas! why did
I not die before this day? Woe is me that my dear
husband is slain! He is dead, and I have no friend to
lament with me. If only I could see his comrades and
tell what has befallen him my heart would be eased of
some of its pain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>William, as he listened, was deeply touched, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg&nbsp;240]</a></span>
walked gently to fair Alice, as she hid her face in her
hands and wept. &ldquo;Welcome, wife, to the greenwood!&rdquo;
quoth he. &ldquo;By heaven, I never thought to
see you again when I lay in bonds last night.&rdquo; Dame
Alice sprang up most joyously. &ldquo;Oh, all is well with
me now you are here; I have no care or woe.&rdquo; &ldquo;For
that you must thank my dear brethren, Adam and
Clym,&rdquo; said he; and Alice began to load them with
her thanks, but Adam cut short the expression of her
gratitude. &ldquo;No need to talk about a little matter like
that,&rdquo; he said gruffly. &ldquo;If we want any supper we
had better kill something, for the meat we must eat is
yet running wild.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With three such good archers game was easily shot
and a merry meal was quickly prepared in the greenwood,
and all joyfully partook of venison and other
dainties. Throughout the repast William devotedly
waited on his wife with deepest love and reverence, for
he could not forget how she had defended him and
risked her life to stand by him.</p>


<h3>William&rsquo;s Proposed Visit to London</h3>

<p>When the meal was over, and they reclined on the
green turf round the fire, William began thoughtfully:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is in my mind that we ought speedily to go to
London and try to win our pardon from the king.
Unless we approach him before news can be brought
from Carlisle he will assuredly slay us. Let us go at
once, leaving my dear wife and my two youngest sons
in a convent here; but I would fain take my eldest boy
with me. If all goes well he can bring good news to
Alice in her nunnery, and if all goes ill he shall bring
her my last wishes. But I am sure I am not meant to
die by the law.&rdquo; His brethren approved the plan, and
they took fair Alice and her two youngest children to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg&nbsp;241]</a></span>
the nunnery, and then the three famous archers with
the little boy of seven set out at their best speed for
London, watching the passers-by carefully, that no news
of the doings in Carlisle should precede them to the
king.</p>


<h3>Outlaws in the Royal Palace</h3>

<p>The three yeomen, on arriving in London, made
their way at once to the king&rsquo;s palace, and walked
boldly into the hall, regardless of the astonished and
indignant shouts of the royal porter. He followed
them angrily into the hall, and began reproaching
them and trying to induce them to withdraw, but to no
purpose. Finally an usher came and said: &ldquo;Yeomen,
what is your wish? Pray tell me, and I will help you
if I can; but if you enter the king&rsquo;s presence thus
unmannerly you will cause us to be blamed. Tell me
now whence you come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>William fearlessly answered: &ldquo;Sir, we will tell the
truth without deceit. We are outlaws from the king&rsquo;s
forests, outlawed for killing the king&rsquo;s deer, and we
come to beg for pardon and a charter of peace, to show
to the sheriff of our county.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The King and the Outlaws</h3>

<p>The usher went to an inner room and begged to
know the king&rsquo;s will, whether he would see these outlaws
or not. The king was interested in these bold
yeomen, who dared to avow themselves law-breakers,
and bade men bring them to audience with him. The
three comrades, with the little boy, on being introduced
into the royal presence, knelt down and held up their
hands, beseeching pardon for their offences.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sire, we beseech your pardon for our breach of
your laws. We are forest outlaws, who have slain your
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg&nbsp;242]</a></span>
fallow deer in many parts of your royal forests.&rdquo; &ldquo;Your
names? Tell me at once,&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;Adam
Bell, Clym of the Cleugh, and William of Cloudeslee,&rdquo;
they replied.</p>

<p>The king was very wrathful. &ldquo;Are you those bold
robbers of whom men have told me? Do you now dare
to come to me for pardon? On mine honour I vow that
you shall all three be hanged without mercy, as I am
crowned king of this realm of England. Arrest them
and lay them in bonds.&rdquo; There was no resistance
possible, and the yeomen submitted ruefully to their
arrest. Adam Bell was the first to speak. &ldquo;As I hope
to thrive, this game pleases me not at all,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Sire, of your mercy, we beg you to remember that we
came to you of our own free will, and to let us pass
away again as freely. Give us back our weapons and
let us have free passage till we have left your palace;
we ask no more; we shall never ask another favour,
however long we live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The king was obdurate, however; he only replied:
&ldquo;You speak proudly still, but you shall all three be
hanged.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The Queen Intercedes</h3>

<p>The queen, who was sitting beside her husband, now
spoke for the first time. &ldquo;Sire, it were a pity that such
good yeomen should die, if they might in any wise be
pardoned.&rdquo; &ldquo;There is no pardon,&rdquo; said the king. She
then replied: &ldquo;My lord, when I first left my native
land and came into this country as your bride you
promised to grant me at once the first boon I asked. I
have never needed to ask one until to-day, but now, sire,
I claim one, and I beg you to grant it.&rdquo; &ldquo;With all my
heart; ask your boon, and it shall be yours willingly.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Then, I pray you, grant me the lives of these good
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg&nbsp;243]</a></span>
yeomen.&rdquo; &ldquo;Madam, you might have had half my kingdom,
and you ask a worthless trifle.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sire, it seems
not worthless to me; I beg you to keep your promise.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Madam, it vexes me that you have asked so little;
yet since you will have these three outlaws, take them.&rdquo;
The queen rejoiced greatly. &ldquo;Many thanks, my lord
and husband. I will be surety for them that they
shall be true men henceforth. But, good my lord, give
them a word of comfort, that they may not be wholly
dismayed by your anger.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>News Comes to the King</h3>

<p>The king smiled at his wife. &ldquo;Ah, madam! you
will have your own way, as all women will. Go,
fellows, wash yourselves, and find places at the tables,
where you shall dine well enough, even if it be not on
venison pasty from the king&rsquo;s own forests.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The outlaws did reverence to the king and queen, and
found seats with the king&rsquo;s guard at the lower tables
in the hall. They were still satisfying their appetites
when a messenger came in haste to the king; and the
three North Countrymen looked at one another uneasily,
for they knew the man was from Carlisle. The
messenger knelt before the king and presented his
letters. &ldquo;Sire, your officers greet you well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How fare they? How does my valiant sheriff?
And the prudent justice? Are they well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas! my lord, they have been slain, and many
another good officer with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who hath done this?&rdquo; questioned the king
angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord, three bold outlaws, Adam Bell, Clym of
the Cleugh, and William of Cloudeslee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! these three whom I have just pardoned?
Ah, sorely I repent that I forgave them! I would give
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg&nbsp;244]</a></span>
a thousand pounds if I could have them hanged all
three; but I cannot.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The King&rsquo;s Test</h3>

<p>As the king read the letters his anger and surprise
increased. It seemed impossible that three men should
overawe a whole town, should slay sheriff, justice,
mayor, and nearly every official in the town, forge a
royal letter with the king&rsquo;s seal, and then lock the
gates and escape safely. There was no doubt of the
fact, and the king raged impotently against his own
foolish mercy in giving them a free pardon. It had
been granted, however, and he could do nought but
grieve over the ruin they had wrought in Carlisle. At
last he sprang up, for he could endure the banquet no
longer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Call my archers to go to the butts,&rdquo; he commanded.
&ldquo;I will see these bold outlaws shoot, and
try if their archery is so fine as men say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Accordingly the king&rsquo;s archers and the queen&rsquo;s
archers arrayed themselves, and the three yeomen took
their bows and looked well to their silken bowstrings;
and then all made their way to the butts where the
targets were set up. The archers shot in turn, aiming
at an ordinary target, but Cloudeslee soon grew weary
of this childish sport, and said aloud: &ldquo;I shall never
call a man a good archer who shoots at a target as large
as a buckler. We have another sort of butt in my
country, and that is worth shooting at.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>William of Cloudeslee&rsquo;s Archery</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Make ready your own butts,&rdquo; the king commanded,
and the three outlaws went to a bush in a
field close by and returned bearing hazel-rods, peeled
and shining white. These rods they set up at four
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg&nbsp;245]</a></span>
hundred yards apart, and, standing by one, they
said to the king: &ldquo;We should account a man a
fair archer if he could split one wand while standing
beside the other.&rdquo; &ldquo;It cannot be done; the feat is
too great,&rdquo; exclaimed the king. &ldquo;Sire, I can easily
do it,&rdquo; quoth Cloudeslee, and, taking aim very carefully,
he shot, and the arrow split the wand in
two. &ldquo;In truth,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;you are the best
archer I have ever seen. Can you do greater wonders?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; quoth Cloudeslee, &ldquo;one thing more
I can do, but it is a more difficult feat. Nevertheless
I will try it, to show you our North Country
shooting.&rdquo; &ldquo;Try, then,&rdquo; the king replied; &ldquo;but if
you fail you shall be hanged without mercy, because
of your boasting.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>Cloudeslee Shoots the Apple from his Son&rsquo;s Head</h3>

<p>Now Cloudeslee stood for a few moments as if
doubtful of himself, and the South Country archers
watched him, hoping for a chance to retrieve their defeat,
when William suddenly said: &ldquo;I have a son, a dear
son, seven years of age. I will tie him to a stake and
place an apple on his head. Then from a distance of a
hundred and twenty yards I will split the apple in two
with a broad arrow.&rdquo; &ldquo;By heaven!&rdquo; the king cried,
&ldquo;that is a dreadful feat. Do as you have said, or by
Him who died on the Cross I will hang you high. Do
as you have said, but if you touch one hair of his head, or
the edge of his gown, I will hang you and your two companions.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I have never broken my pledged word,&rdquo;
said the North Country bowman, and he at once made
ready for the terrible trial. The stake was set in the
ground, the boy tied to it, with his face turned from his
father, lest he should give a start and destroy his aim.
Cloudeslee then paced the hundred and twenty yards,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg&nbsp;246]</a></span>
anxiously felt his string, bent his bow, chose his broadest
arrow, and fitted it with care.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 401px;">

<a name="image_page_244" id="image_page_244"></a>
</div>

<p class="caption">William of Cloudeslee and his son</p>


<h3>The Last Shot</h3>

<p>It was an anxious moment. The throng of spectators
felt sick with expectation, and many women wept and
prayed for the father and his innocent son. But
Cloudeslee showed no fear. He addressed the crowd
gravely: &ldquo;Good folk, stand all as still as may be. For
such a shot a man needs a steady hand, and your movements
may destroy my aim and make me slay my son.
Pray for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, in an unbroken silence of breathless suspense,
the bold marksman shot, and the apple fell
to the ground, cleft into two absolutely equal halves.
A cheer from every spectator burst forth deafeningly,
and did not die down till the king beckoned for
silence.</p>


<h3>The King and Queen Show Favour</h3>

<p>&ldquo;God forbid that I should ever be your target,&rdquo;
quoth he. &ldquo;You shall be my chief forester in the North
Country, with daily wage, and daily right of killing
venison; your two brethren shall become yeomen of
my guard, and I will advance the fortunes of your
family in every way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The queen smiled graciously upon William, and
she bestowed a pension upon him, and bade him
bring his wife, fair Alice, to court, to take up the
post of chief woman of the bedchamber to the royal
children.</p>

<p>Overwhelmed with these favours, the three yeomen
became conscious of their own offences, more than they
had told to the royal pair; their awakened consciences
sent them to a holy bishop, who heard their confessions,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg&nbsp;247]</a></span>
gave them penance and bade them live well for the
future, and then absolved them. When they had
returned to Englewood Forest and had broken up the
outlaw band they came back to the royal court, and
spent the rest of their lives in great favour with the
king and queen.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII: BLACK COLIN OF
LOCH AWE</h2>


<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N considering the hero-myths of Scotland we are
at once confronted with two difficulties. The first,
and perhaps the greater, is this, that the only
national heroes of Lowland Scotland are actual historical
persons, with very little of the mythical character about
them. The mention of Scottish heroes at once suggests
Sir William Wallace, Robert Bruce, the Black Douglas,
Sir Andrew Barton, and many more, whose exploits are
matter of serious chronicle and sober record rather than
subject of tradition and myth. These warriors are too
much in reach of the fierce white searchlight of historic
inquiry to be invested with mythical interest or to show
any developments of ancient legend.</p>

<p>The second difficulty is of a different nature, and
yet almost equally perplexing. In the old ballads and
poems of the Gaelic Highlands there are mythical
heroes in abundance, such as Fingal and Ossian, Comala,
and a host of shadowy chieftains and warriors, but they
are not distinctively Scotch. They are only Highland
Gaelic versions of the Irish Gaelic hero-legends, Scotch
embodiments of Finn and Oisin, whose real home was
in Ireland, and whose legends were carried to the
Western Isles and the Highlands by conquering tribes
of Scots from Erin. These heroes are at bottom Irish,
the champions of the Fenians and of the Red Branch,
and in the Scotch legends they have lost much of their
original beauty and chivalry.</p>


<h3>The Highland Clans</h3>

<p>It is rather in the private history of the country, as
it were, than in its national records that we are likely
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg&nbsp;249]</a></span>
to find a hero who will have something of the mythical
in his story, something of the romance of the Middle
Ages. The wars and jealousies of the clans, the
adventures of a chief among hostile tribesmen, the
raids and forays, the loves and hatreds of rival families,
form a good background for a romantic legend; and
such a legend occurs in the story of Black Colin of
Loch Awe, a warrior of the great Campbell clan in the
fourteenth century. The tale is common in one form
or another to all European lands where the call of the
Crusades was heard, and the romantic Crusading element
has to a certain extent softened the occasionally
ferocious nature of Highland stories in general, so that
there is no bloodthirsty vengeance, no long blood-feud,
to be recorded of Black Colin Campbell.</p>


<h3>The Knight of Loch Awe</h3>

<p>During the wars between England and Scotland in
the reigns of Edward I. and Edward II. one of the
chief leaders in the cause of Scottish independence was
Sir Nigel Campbell. The Knight of Loch Awe, as he
was generally called, was a schoolfellow and comrade of
Sir William Wallace, and a loyal and devoted adherent
of Robert Bruce. In return for his services in the war
of independence Bruce rewarded him with lands belonging
to the rebellious MacGregors, including Glenurchy,
the great glen at the head of Loch Awe through which
flows the river Orchy. It was a wild and lonely district,
and Sir Nigel Campbell had much conflict before
he finally expelled the MacGregors and settled down
peaceably in Glenurchy. There his son was born, and
named Colin, and as years passed he won the nickname
of Black Colin, from his swarthy complexion, or possibly
from his character, which showed tokens of unusual
fierceness and determination.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg&nbsp;250]</a></span></p>

<h3>Black Colin&rsquo;s Youth</h3>

<p>Sir Nigel Campbell, as all Highland chiefs did,
sent his son to a farmer&rsquo;s family for fosterage. The
boy became a child of his foster-family in every way;
he lived on the plain food of the clansmen, oatmeal
porridge and oatcake, milk from the cows, and beef
from the herds; he ran and wrestled and hunted with
his foster-brothers, and learnt woodcraft and warlike
skill, broadsword play and the use of dirk and buckler,
from his foster-father. More than all, he won a devoted
following in the clan, for a man&rsquo;s foster-parents were
almost dearer to him than his own father and mother,
and his foster-brethren were bound to fight and die
for him, and to regard him more than their own blood-relations.
The foster-parents of Black Colin were
a farmer and his wife, Patterson by name, living at
Socach, in Glenurchy, and well and truly they fulfilled
their trust.</p>


<h3>He Goes on Crusade</h3>

<p>In course of time Sir Nigel Campbell died, and
Black Colin, his son, became Knight of Loch Awe, and
lord of all Glenurchy and the country round. He was
already noted for his strength and his dark complexion,
which added to his beauty in the eyes of the maidens,
and he soon found a lovely and loving bride. They
dwelt on the Islet in Loch Awe, and were very happy
for a short time, but Colin was always restless, because
he would fain do great deeds of arms, and there was
peace just then in the land.</p>

<p>At last one day a messenger arrived at the castle on the
Islet bearing tidings that another crusade was on foot.
This messenger was a palmer who had been in the
Holy Land, and had seen all the holy places in Jerusalem.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg&nbsp;251]</a></span>
He told Black Colin how the Saracens ruled the country,
and hindered men from worshipping at the sacred
shrines; and he told how he had come home by Rome,
where the Pope had just proclaimed another Holy
War. The Pope had declared that his blessing would
rest on the man who should leave wife and home and
kinsfolk, and go forth to fight for the Lord against the
infidel. As the palmer spoke Black Colin became
greatly moved by his words, and when the old man
had made an end he raised the hilt of his dirk and
swore by the cross thereon that he would obey the
summons and go on crusade.</p>


<h3>The Lady of Loch Awe</h3>

<p>Now Black Colin&rsquo;s wife was greatly grieved, and
wept sorely, for she was but young, and had been
wedded no more than a year, and it seemed to her hard
that she must be left alone. She asked her husband:
&ldquo;How far will you go on this errand?&rdquo; &ldquo;I will go
as far as Jerusalem, if the Pope bids me, when I have
come to Rome,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Alas! and how long will
you be away from me?&rdquo; &ldquo;That I know not, but
it may be for years if the heathen Saracens will not
surrender the Holy Land to the warriors of the
Cross.&rdquo; &ldquo;What shall I do during those long, weary
years?&rdquo; asked she. &ldquo;Dear love, you shall dwell
here on the Islet and be Lady of Glenurchy till I
return again. The vassals and clansmen shall obey
you in my stead, and the tenants shall pay you their
rents and their dues, and in all things you shall hold
my land for me.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The Token</h3>

<p>The Lady of Loch Awe sighed as she asked: &ldquo;But if
you die away in that distant land how shall I know?
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg&nbsp;252]</a></span>
What will become of me if at last such woeful tidings
should be brought?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait for me seven years, dear wife,&rdquo; said Colin,
&ldquo;and if I do not return before the end of that time
you may marry again and take a brave husband to
guard your rights and rule the glen, for I shall be
dead in the Holy Land.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;Wait for me seven years, dear wife&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I will never do. I will be the Lady of Glenurchy
till I die, or I will become the bride of Heaven
and find peace for my sorrowing soul in a nunnery. No
second husband shall wed me and hold your land. But
give me now some token that we may share it between
us; and you shall swear that on your deathbed you
will send it to me; so shall I know indeed that you
are no longer alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It shall be as you say,&rdquo; answered Black Colin,
and he went to the smith of the clan and bade him
make a massive gold ring, on which Colin&rsquo;s name was
engraved, as well as that of the Lady of Loch Awe.
Then, breaking the ring in two, Colin gave to his
wife the piece with his name and kept the other
piece, vowing to wear it near his heart and only to
part with it when he should be dying. In like
manner she with bitter weeping swore to keep her
half of the ring, and hung it on a chain round her
neck; and so, with much grief and great mourning
from the whole clan, Black Colin and his sturdy
following of Campbell clansmen set out for the Holy
Land.</p>


<h3>The Journey</h3>

<p>Sadly at first the little band marched away from all
their friends and their homes; bagpipes played their
loudest marching tunes, and plaids fluttered in the
breeze, and the men marched gallantly, but with heavy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg&nbsp;253]</a></span>
hearts, for they knew not when they would return, and
they feared to find supplanters in their homes when
they came back after many years. Their courage rose,
however, as the miles lengthened behind them, and by
the time they had reached Edinburgh and had taken
ship at Leith all was forgotten but the joy of fighting
and the eager desire to see Rome and the Pope, the
Holy Land and the Holy Sepulchre. Journeying up
the Rhine, the Highland clansmen made their way
through Switzerland and over the passes of the Alps
down into the pleasant land of Italy, where the splendour
of the cities surpassed their wildest imaginations;
and so they came at last, with many other bands of
Crusaders, to Rome.</p>


<h3>The Crusade</h3>

<p>At Rome the Knight of Loch Awe was so fortunate
as to have an audience of the Pope himself, who was
touched by the devotion which brought these stern
warriors so far from their home. Black Colin knelt in
reverence before the aged pontiff, whom he held in
truth to be the Vicar of Christ on earth, and received
his blessing, and commands to continue his journey to
Rhodes, where the Knights of St. John would give him
opportunity to fight for the faith. The small band of
Campbells went on to Rhodes, and there took service
with the Knights, and won great praise from the Grand
Master; but, though they fought the infidel, and
exalted the standard of the Cross above the Crescent,
Colin was still not at all satisfied. He left Rhodes
after some years with a much-diminished band, and
made his way as a pilgrim to Jerusalem. There he
stayed until he had visited all the shrines in the Holy
Land and prayed at every sacred spot. By this time
the seven years of his proposed absence were ended,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg&nbsp;254]</a></span>
and he was still far from his home and the dear glen
by Loch Awe.</p>


<h3>The Lady&rsquo;s Suitor</h3>

<p>While the seven years slowly passed away his sad and
lonely wife dwelt in the castle on the Islet, ruling her
lord&rsquo;s clan in all gentle ways, but fighting boldly when
raiders came to plunder her clansmen. Yearly she
claimed her husband&rsquo;s dues and watched that he was
not defrauded of his rights. But though thus firm,
she was the best help in trouble that her clan ever had,
and all blessed the name of the Lady of Loch Awe.</p>

<p>So fair and gentle a lady, so beloved by her clan,
was certain to have suitors if she were a widow, and
even before the seven years had passed away there were
men who would gladly have persuaded her that her
husband was dead and that she was free. She, however,
steadfastly refused to hear a word of another marriage,
saying: &ldquo;When Colin parted from me he gave me two
promises, one to return, if possible, within seven years,
and the other to send me, on his deathbed, if he died
away from me, a sure token of his death. I have not
yet waited seven years, nor have I had the token of his
death. I am still the wife of Black Colin of Loch Awe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This steadfastness gradually daunted her suitors and
they left her alone, until but one remained, the Baron
Niel MacCorquodale, whose lands bordered on Glenurchy,
and who had long cast covetous eyes on the
glen and its fair lady, and longed no less for the wealth
she was reputed to possess than for the power this
marriage would give him.</p>


<h3>The Baron&rsquo;s Plot</h3>

<p>When the seven years were over the Baron MacCorquodale
sought the Lady of Loch Awe again, wooing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg&nbsp;255]</a></span>
her for his wife. Again she refused, saying, &ldquo;Until
I have the token of my husband&rsquo;s death I will be
wife to no other man.&rdquo; &ldquo;And what is this token,
lady?&rdquo; asked the Baron, for he thought he could send
a false one. &ldquo;I will never tell that,&rdquo; replied the lady.
&ldquo;Do you dare to ask the most sacred secret between
husband and wife? I shall know the token when it
comes.&rdquo; The Baron was not a little enraged that he
could not discover the secret, but he determined to
wed the lady and her wealth notwithstanding; accordingly
he wrote by a sure and secret messenger to a
friend in Rome, bidding him send a letter with
news that Black Colin was assuredly dead, and that
certain words (which the Baron dictated) had come
from him.</p>


<h3>A Forged Letter</h3>

<p>One day the Lady of Loch Awe, looking out from her
castle, saw the Baron coming, and with him a palmer
whose face was bronzed by Eastern suns. She felt that
the palmer would bring tidings, and welcomed the
Baron with his companion. &ldquo;Lady, this palmer brings
you sad news,&rdquo; quoth the Baron. &ldquo;Let him tell it,
then,&rdquo; replied she, sick with fear. &ldquo;Alas! fair dame,
if you were the wife of that gallant knight Colin of
Loch Awe, you are now his widow,&rdquo; said the palmer
sadly, as he handed her a letter. &ldquo;What proof have
you?&rdquo; asked Black Colin&rsquo;s wife before she read the
letter. &ldquo;Lady, I talked with the soldier who brought
the tidings,&rdquo; replied the stranger.</p>

<p>The letter was written from Rome to &ldquo;The Right
Noble Dame the Lady of Loch Awe,&rdquo; and told how
news had come from Rhodes, brought by a man of
Black Colin&rsquo;s band, that the Knight of Loch Awe had
been mortally wounded in a fight against the Saracens.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg&nbsp;256]</a></span>
Dying, he had bidden his clansmen return to their
lady, but they had all perished but one, fighting for
vengeance against the infidels. This man, who had
held the dying Knight tenderly upon his knee, said
that Colin bade his wife farewell, bade her remember
his injunction to wed again and find a protector, gasped
out, &ldquo;Take her the token I promised; it is here,&rdquo; and
died; but the Saracens attacked the Christians again,
drove them back, and plundered the bodies of the slain,
and when the one survivor returned to search for the
precious token there was none! The body was stripped
of everything of value, and the clansman wound it in
the plaid and buried it on the battlefield.</p>


<h3>The Lady&rsquo;s Stratagem</h3>

<p>There seemed no reason for the lady to doubt this
news, and her grief was very real and sincere. She clad
herself in mourning robes and bewailed her lost husband,
but yet she was not entirely satisfied, for she still wore
the broken half of the engraved ring on the chain round
her neck, and still the promised death-token had not
come. The Baron now pressed his suit with greater
ardour than before, and the Lady of Loch Awe was hard
put to it to find reasons for refusing him. It was
necessary to keep him on good terms with the clan, for
his lands bordered on those of Glenurchy, and he could
have made war on the people in the glen quite easily,
while the knowledge that their chief was dead would
have made them a broken clan. So the lady turned to
guile, as did Penelope of old in similar distress. &ldquo;I
will wed you, now that my Colin is dead,&rdquo; she replied
at last, &ldquo;but it cannot be immediately; I must first
build a castle that will command the head of Glenurchy
and of Loch Awe. The MacGregors knew the best place
for a house, there on Innis Eoalan; there, where the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg&nbsp;257]</a></span>
ruins of MacGregor&rsquo;s White House now stand, will I
build my castle. When it is finished the time of my
mourning will be over, and I will fix the bridal day.&rdquo;
With this promise the Baron had perforce to be contented,
and the castle began to rise slowly at the head of
Loch Awe; but its progress was not rapid, because the
lady secretly bade her men build feebly, and often the
walls fell down, so that the new castle was very long
in coming to completion.</p>


<h3>Black Colin Hears the News</h3>

<p>In the meantime all who loved Black Colin grieved
to know that the Lady of Loch Awe would wed again,
and his foster-mother sorrowed most of all, for she felt
sure that her beloved Colin was not dead. The death-token
had not been sent, and she sorely mistrusted the
Baron MacCorquodale and doubted the truth of the
palmer&rsquo;s message. At last, when the new castle was
nearly finished and shone white in the rays of the sun,
she called one of her sons and bade him journey to
Rome to find the Knight of Loch Awe, if he were yet
alive, and to bring sure tidings of his death if he were
no longer living. The young Patterson set off secretly,
and reached Rome in due course, and there he met
Black Colin, just returned from Jerusalem. The Knight
had at last realized that he had spent seven years away
from his home, and that now, in spite of all his haste,
he might reach Glenurchy too late to save his wife from
a second marriage. He comforted himself, however,
with the thought that the token was still safe with him,
and that his wife would be loyal; great, therefore, was
his horror when he met his foster-brother and heard how
the news of his death had been brought to the glen.
He heard also how his wife had reluctantly promised
to marry the Baron MacCorquodale, and had delayed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg&nbsp;258]</a></span>
her wedding by stratagem, and he vowed that he would
return to Glenurchy in time to spoil the plans of the
wicked baron.</p>


<h3>Black Colin&rsquo;s Return</h3>

<p>Travelling day and night, Black Colin, with his faithful
clansman, came near to Glenurchy, and sent his
follower on in advance to bring back news. The youth
returned with tidings that the wedding had been fixed
for the next day, since the castle was finished and no
further excuse for delay could be made. Then Colin&rsquo;s
anger was greatly roused, and he vowed that the Baron
MacCorquodale, who had stooped to deceit and forgery
to gain his ends, should pay dearly for his baseness.
Bidding his young clansman show no sign of recognition
when he appeared, the Knight of Loch Awe sent him to
the farm in the glen, where the anxious foster-mother
eagerly awaited the return of the wanderer. When she
saw her son appear alone she was plunged into despair,
for she concluded, not that Black Colin was dead,
but that he would return too late. When he, in the
beggar&rsquo;s disguise which he assumed, came down the
Glen he saw the smoke from the castle on the Islet,
and said: &ldquo;I see smoke from my house, and it is the
smoke of a wedding feast in preparation, but I pray
God who sent us light and love that I may reap the
fruit of the love that is there.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The Foster-Mother&rsquo;s Recognition</h3>

<p>The Knight then went to his foster-mother&rsquo;s house,
knocked at the door, and humbly craved food and
shelter, as a beggar. &ldquo;Come in, good man,&rdquo; quoth
the mistress of the house; &ldquo;sit down in the chimney-corner,
and you shall have your fill of oatcake and
milk.&rdquo; Colin sat down heavily, as if he were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg&nbsp;259]</a></span>
overwearied, and the farmer&rsquo;s wife moved about slowly, putting
before him what she had; and the Knight saw that
she did not recognise him, and that she had been weeping
quite recently. &ldquo;You are sad, I can see,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;What is the cause of your grief?&rdquo; &ldquo;I am not minded
to tell that to a wandering stranger,&rdquo; she replied.
&ldquo;Perhaps I can guess what it is,&rdquo; he continued; &ldquo;you
have lost some dear friend, I think.&rdquo; &ldquo;My loss is great
enough to give me grief,&rdquo; she answered, weeping. &ldquo;I
had a dear foster-son, who went oversea to fight the
heathen. He was dearer to me than my own sons, and
now news has come that he is dead in that foreign land.
And the Lady of Loch Awe, who was his wife, is to wed
another husband to-morrow. Long she waited for him,
past the seven years he was to be away, and now she
would not marry again, but that a letter has come to
assure her of his death. Even yet she is fretting
because she has not had the token he promised to
send her; and she will only marry because she dare
no longer delay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is this token?&rdquo; asked Colin. &ldquo;That I know
not: she has never told,&rdquo; replied the foster-mother;
&ldquo;but oh! if he were now here Glenurchy would never fall
under the power of Baron MacCorquodale.&rdquo; &ldquo;Would
you know Black Colin if you were to see him?&rdquo; the
beggar asked meaningly; and she replied: &ldquo;I think I
should, for though he has been away for years, I nursed
him, and he is my own dear fosterling.&rdquo; &ldquo;Look well at
me, then, good mother of mine, for I am Colin of Loch
Awe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mistress of the farm seized the beggar-man by
the arm, drew him out into the light, and looked
earnestly into his face; then, with a scream of joy, she
flung her arms around him, and cried: &ldquo;O Colin!
Colin! my dear son, home again at last! Glad and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg&nbsp;260]</a></span>
glad I am to see you here in time! Weary have the
years been since my nursling went away, but now you
are home all will be well.&rdquo; And she embraced him and
kissed him and stroked his hair, and exclaimed at his
bronzed hue and his ragged attire.</p>


<h3>The Foster-Mother&rsquo;s Plan</h3>

<p>At last Colin stopped her raptures. &ldquo;Tell me,
mother, does my wife seem to wish for this marriage?&rdquo;
he asked; and his foster-mother answered: &ldquo;Nay, my
son, she would not wed now but that, thinking you are
dead, she fears the Baron&rsquo;s anger if she continues to
refuse him. But if you doubt her heart, follow my
counsel, and you shall be assured of her will in this
matter.&rdquo; &ldquo;What do you advise?&rdquo; asked he. She
answered: &ldquo;Stay this night with me here, and to-morrow
go in your beggar&rsquo;s dress to the castle on the Islet. Stand
with other beggars at the door, and refuse to go until
the bride herself shall bring you food and drink. Then
you can put your token in the cup the Lady of Loch Awe
will hand you, and by her behaviour you shall learn if
her heart is in this marriage or not.&rdquo; &ldquo;Dear mother,
your plan is good, and I will follow it,&rdquo; quoth Colin.
&ldquo;This night I will rest here, and on the morrow I will
seek my wife.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The Beggar at the Wedding</h3>

<p>Early next day Colin arose, clad himself in the disguise
of a sturdy beggar, took a kindly farewell of his
foster-mother, and made his way to the castle. Early
as it was, all the servants were astir, and the whole place
was in a bustle of preparation, while vagabonds of every
description hung round the doors, begging for food and
money in honour of the day. The new-comer acted
much more boldly: he planted himself right in the open
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg&nbsp;261]</a></span>
doorway and begged for food and drink in such a lordly
tone that the servants were impressed by it, and one of
them brought him what he asked&mdash;oatcake and buttermilk&mdash;and
gave it to him, saying, &ldquo;Take this and begone.&rdquo;
Colin took the alms and drank the buttermilk,
but put the cake into his wallet, and stood sturdily
right in the doorway, so that the servants found it difficult
to enter. Another servant came to him with more
food and a horn of ale, saying, &ldquo;Now take this second
gift of food and begone, for you are in our way here,
and hinder us in our work.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The Beggar&rsquo;s Demand</h3>

<p>But he stood more firmly still, with his stout travelling-staff
planted on the threshold, and said: &ldquo;I will not
go.&rdquo; Then a third servant approached, who said: &ldquo;Go
at once, or it will be the worse for you. We have given
you quite enough for one beggar. Leave quickly now,
or you will get us and yourself into trouble.&rdquo; The
disguised Knight only replied: &ldquo;I will not go until the
bride herself comes out to give me a drink of wine,&rdquo;
and he would not move, for all they could say. The
servants at last grew so perplexed that they went to
tell their mistress about this importunate beggar. She
laughed as she said: &ldquo;It is not much for me to do on
my last day in the old house,&rdquo; and she bade a servant
attend her to the door, bringing a large jug full of wine.</p>


<h3>The Token</h3>

<p>As the unhappy bride came out to the beggar-man
he bent his head in greeting, and she noticed his
travel-stained dress and said: &ldquo;You have come from
far, good man&rdquo;; and he replied: &ldquo;Yes, lady, I have
seen many distant lands.&rdquo; &ldquo;Alas! others have gone
to see distant lands and have not returned,&rdquo; said she.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg&nbsp;262]</a></span>
&ldquo;If you would have a drink from the hands of the
bride herself, I am she, and you may take your wine
now&rdquo;; and, holding a bowl in her hands, she bade the
servant fill it with wine, and then gave it to Colin.
&ldquo;I drink to your happiness,&rdquo; said he, and drained the
bowl. As he gave it back to the lady he placed within
it the token, the half of the engraved ring. &ldquo;I return
it richer than I took it, lady,&rdquo; said he, and his wife
looked within and saw the token.</p>


<h3>The Recognition</h3>

<p>Trembling violently, she snatched the tiny bit of
gold from the bottom of the bowl, which fell to the
ground and broke at her feet, and then she saw her
own name engraved upon it. She looked long and
long at the token, and then, pulling a chain at her
neck, drew out her half of the ring with Colin&rsquo;s name
engraved on it. &ldquo;O stranger, tell me, is my husband
dead?&rdquo; she asked, grasping the beggar&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Dead?&rdquo;
he questioned, gazing tenderly at her; and at his tone
she looked straight into his eyes and knew him.
&ldquo;My husband!&rdquo; was all that she could say, but she
flung her arms around his neck and was clasped close
to his heart. The servants stood bewildered, but
in a moment their mistress had turned to them,
saying, &ldquo;Run, summon all the household, bring them
all, for this is my husband, Black Colin of Loch Awe,
come home to me again.&rdquo; When all in the castle knew
it there was great excitement and rejoicing, and they
feasted bountifully, for the wedding banquet had been
prepared.</p>


<h3>The Baron&rsquo;s Flight</h3>

<p>While the feast was in progress, and the happy wife
sat by her long-lost husband and held his hand, as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg&nbsp;263]</a></span>
though she feared to let him leave her, a distant sound
of bagpipes was heard, and the lady remembered that
the Baron MacCorquodale would be coming for his
wedding, which she had entirely forgotten in her joy.
She laughed lightly to herself, and, beckoning a clansman,
bade him go and tell the Baron that she would take no
new husband, since her old one had come back to her,
and that there would be questions to be answered when
time served. The Baron MacCorquodale, in his wedding
finery, with a great party of henchmen and vassals and
pipers blowing a wedding march, had reached the mouth
of the river which enters the side of Loch Awe; the
party had crossed the river, and were ready to take
boat across to the Islet, when they saw a solitary man
rowing towards them with all speed. &ldquo;It is some
messenger from my lady,&rdquo; said the Baron, and he
waited eagerly to hear the message. With dreadful
consternation he listened to the unexpected words as
the clansman delivered them, and then bade the pipers
cease their music. &ldquo;We must return; there will be
no wedding to-day, since Black Colin is home again,&rdquo;
quoth he; and the crestfallen party retraced their steps,
quickening them more and more as they thought of the
vengeance of the long-lost chieftain; but they reached
their home in safety.</p>


<h3>Castle Kilchurn</h3>

<p>In the meantime Colin had much to tell his wife of
his adventures, and to ask her of her life all these years.
They told each other all, and Colin saw the false letter
that had been sent to the Lady of Loch Awe, and guessed
who had plotted this deceit. His anger grew against
the bad man who had wrought this wrong and had so
nearly gained his end, and he vowed that he would
make the Baron dearly abide it. His wife calmed his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg&nbsp;264]</a></span>
fury somewhat by telling him how she had waited even
beyond the seven years, and what stratagem she had
used, and at last he promised not to make war on the
Baron, but to punish him in other ways.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me what you have done with the rents of
Glenurchy these seven years,&rdquo; said he. Then the
happy wife replied: &ldquo;With part I have lived, with part
I have guarded the glen, and with part have I made a
cairn of stones at the head of Loch Awe. Will you
come with me and see it?&rdquo; And Colin went, deeply
puzzled. When they came to the head of Loch Awe,
there stood the new castle, on the site of the old house
of the MacGregors; and the proud wife laughed as she
said: &ldquo;Do you like my cairn of stones? It has taken
long to build.&rdquo; Black Colin was much pleased with
the beautiful castle she had raised for him, and renamed
it Kilchurn Castle, which title it still keeps. True to
his vow, he took no bloody vengeance on the Baron
MacCorquodale, but when a few years after he fell
into his power the Knight of Loch Awe forced him to
resign a great part of his lands to be united with those
of Glenurchy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII: THE MARRIAGE OF
SIR GAWAYNE</h2>


<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE heroes of chivalry, from Roland the noble
paladin to Spenser&rsquo;s Red-Cross Knight, have
many virtues to uphold, and their characteristics
are as varied as are the races which adopted chivalry
and embodied it in their hero-myths. It is a far cry
from the loyalty of Roland, in which love for his
emperor is the predominant characteristic, to the tender
and graceful reverence of Sir Calidore; but medi&aelig;val
Wales, which has preserved the Arthurian legend most
free from alien admixture, had a knight of courtesy quite
equal to Sir Calidore. Courage was one quality on the
possession of which these medi&aelig;val knights never prided
themselves, because they could not imagine life without
courage, but gentle courtesy was, unhappily, rare, and
many a heroic legend is spoilt by the insolence of the
hero to people of lower rank. Again, the legends often
look lightly on the ill-treatment of maidens; yet the
true hero is one who is never tempted to injure a
defenceless woman. Similarly, a broken oath to a
heathen or mere churl is excused as a trifling matter,
but the ideal hero sweareth and breaketh not, though it
be to his own hindrance.</p>


<h3>Sir Gawayne</h3>

<p>The true Knight of Courtesy is Sir Gawayne, King
Arthur&rsquo;s nephew, who in many ways overshadows his
more illustrious uncle. It is remarkable that the King
Arthur of the medi&aelig;val romances is either a mere
ordinary conqueror or a secondary figure set in the
background to heighten the achievements of his more
warlike followers. The latter is the conception of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg&nbsp;266]</a></span>
Arthur which we find in this legend of the gentle and
courteous Sir Gawayne.</p>


<h3>King Arthur Keeps Christmas</h3>

<p>One year the noble King Arthur was keeping his
Christmas at Carlisle with great pomp and state. By
his side sat his lovely Queen Guenever, the brightest
and most beauteous bride that a king ever wedded, and
about him were gathered the Knights of the Round
Table. Never had a king assembled so goodly a
company of valiant warriors as now sat in due order at
the Round Table in the great hall of Carlisle Castle,
and King Arthur&rsquo;s heart was filled with pride as he looked
on his heroes. There sat Sir Lancelot, not yet the
betrayer of his lord&rsquo;s honour and happiness, with Sir
Bors and Sir Banier, there Sir Bedivere, loyal to King
Arthur till death, there surly Sir Kay, the churlish
steward of the king&rsquo;s household, and King Arthur&rsquo;s
nephews, the young and gallant Sir Gareth, the gentle
and courteous Sir Gawayne, and the false, gloomy Sir
Mordred, who wrought King Arthur&rsquo;s overthrow. The
knights and ladies were ranged in their fitting degrees
and ranks, the servants and pages waited and carved
and filled the golden goblets, and the minstrels sang to
their harps lays of heroes of the olden time.</p>


<h3>His Discontent</h3>

<p>Yet in the midst of all this splendour the king was
ill at ease, for he was a warlike knight and longed for
some new adventure, and of late none had been known.
Arthur sat moodily among his knights and drained the
wine-cup in silence, and Queen Guenever, gazing at
her husband, durst not interrupt his gloomy thoughts.
At last the king raised his head, and, striking the table
with his hand, exclaimed fiercely: &ldquo;Are all my knights
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg&nbsp;267]</a></span>
sluggards or cowards, that none of them goes forth to
seek adventures? You are better fitted to feast well
in hall than fight well in field. Is my fame so greatly
decayed that no man cares to ask for my help or my
support against evildoers? I vow here, by the boar&rsquo;s
head and by Our Lady, that I will not rise from this
table till some adventure be undertaken.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sire, your
loyal knights have gathered round you to keep the holy
Yuletide in your court,&rdquo; replied Sir Lancelot; and Sir
Gawayne said: &ldquo;Fair uncle, we are not cowards, but few
evildoers dare to show themselves under your rule;
hence it is that we seem idle. But see yonder! By
my faith, now cometh an adventure.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The Damsel&rsquo;s Request</h3>

<p>Even as Sir Gawayne spoke a fair damsel rode into
the hall, with flying hair and disordered dress, and,
dismounting from her steed, knelt down sobbing at
Arthur&rsquo;s feet. She cried aloud, so that all heard her:
&ldquo;A boon, a boon, King Arthur! I beg a boon of you!&rdquo;
&ldquo;What is your request?&rdquo; said the king, for the maiden
was in great distress, and her tears filled his heart with
pity. &ldquo;What would you have of me?&rdquo; &ldquo;I cry for
vengeance on a churlish knight, who has separated my
love from me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Tell your story quickly,&rdquo; said King
Arthur; and all the knights listened while the lady
spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was betrothed to a gallant knight,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;whom I loved dearly, and we were entirely happy
until yesterday. Then as we rode out together
planning our marriage we came, through the moorland
ways, unnoticing, to a fair lake, Tarn Wathelan, where
stood a great castle, with streamers flying, and banners
waving in the wind. It seemed a strong and goodly
place, but alas! it stood on magic ground, and within
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg&nbsp;268]</a></span>
the enchanted circle of its shadow an evil spell fell on
every knight who set foot therein. As my love and I
looked idly at the mighty keep a horrible and churlish
warrior, twice the size of mortal man, rushed forth in
complete armour; grim and fierce-looking he was,
armed with a huge club, and sternly he bade my
knight leave me to him and go his way alone. Then
my love drew his sword to defend me, but the evil
spell had robbed him of all strength, and he could do
nought against the giant&rsquo;s club; his sword fell from his
feeble hand, and the churlish knight, seizing him, caused
him to be flung into a dungeon. He then returned and
sorely ill-treated me, though I prayed for mercy in the
name of chivalry and of Mary Mother. At last, when
he set me free and bade me go, I said I would come
to King Arthur&rsquo;s court and beg a champion of might
to avenge me, perhaps even the king himself. But
the giant only laughed aloud. &lsquo;Tell the foolish
king,&rsquo; quoth he, &lsquo;that here I stay his coming, and
that no fear of him shall stop my working my will on
all who come. Many knights have I in prison, some
of them King Arthur&rsquo;s own true men; wherefore bid
him fight with me, if he will win them back.&rsquo; Thus,
laughing and jeering loudly at you, King Arthur, the
churlish knight returned to his castle, and I rode to
Carlisle as fast as I could.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>King Arthur&rsquo;s Vow</h3>

<p>When the lady had ended her sorrowful tale all
present were greatly moved with indignation and pity,
but King Arthur felt the insult most deeply. He
sprang to his feet in great wrath, and cried aloud: &ldquo;I
vow by my knighthood, and by the Holy Rood, that I
will go forth to find that proud giant, and will never
leave him till I have overcome him.&rdquo; The knights
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg&nbsp;269]</a></span>
applauded their lord&rsquo;s vow, but Queen Guenever looked
doubtfully at the king, for she had noticed the damsel&rsquo;s
mention of magic, and she feared some evil adventure
for her husband. The damsel stayed in Carlisle that
night, and in the morning, after he had heard Mass, and
bidden farewell to his wife, King Arthur rode away.
It was a lonely journey to Tarn Wathelan, but the country
was very beautiful, though wild and rugged, and the king
soon saw the little lake gleaming clear and cold below
him, while the enchanted castle towered up above the
water, with banners flaunting defiantly in the wind.</p>


<h3>The Fight</h3>

<p>The king drew his sword Excalibur and blew a loud
note on his bugle. Thrice his challenge note resounded,
but brought no reply, and then he cried aloud: &ldquo;Come
forth, proud knight! King Arthur is here to punish
you for your misdeeds! Come forth and fight bravely.
If you are afraid, then come forth and yield yourself
my thrall.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 413px;">

<a name="image_page_268" id="image_page_268"></a>
</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;The King blew a loud note on his bugle&rdquo;</p>

<p>The churlish giant darted out at the summons, brandishing
his massive club, and rushed straight at King
Arthur. The spell of the enchanted ground seized the
king at that moment, and his hand sank down. Down
fell his good sword Excalibur, down fell his shield, and
he found himself ignominiously helpless in the presence
of his enemy.</p>


<h3>The Ransom</h3>

<p>Now the giant cried aloud: &ldquo;Yield or fight, King
Arthur; which will you do? If you fight I shall conquer
you, for you have no power to resist me; you will
be my prisoner, with no hope of ransom, will lose your
land and spend your life in my dungeon with many
other brave knights. If you yield I will hold you to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg&nbsp;270]</a></span>
ransom, but you must swear to accept the terms I
shall offer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are they,&rdquo; asked King Arthur. The giant
replied: &ldquo;You must swear solemnly, by the Holy Rood,
that you will return here on New Year&rsquo;s Day and
bring me a true answer to the question, &lsquo;What thing
is it that all women most desire?&rsquo; If you fail to bring
the right answer your ransom is not paid, and you are
yet my prisoner. Do you accept my terms?&rdquo; The
king had no alternative: so long as he stood on the
enchanted ground his courage was overborne by the
spell and he could only hold up his hand and swear by
the Sacred Cross and by Our Lady that he would return,
with such answers as he could obtain, on New Year&rsquo;s Day.</p>


<h3>The King&rsquo;s Search</h3>

<p>Ashamed and humiliated, the king rode away, but
not back to Carlisle&mdash;he would not return home till he
had fulfilled his task; so he rode east and west and
north and south, and asked every woman and maid he
met the question the churlish knight had put to him.
&ldquo;What is it all women most desire?&rdquo; he asked,
and all gave him different replies: some said riches,
some splendour, some pomp and state; others declared
that fine attire was women&rsquo;s chief delight, yet others
voted for mirth or flattery; some declared that a handsome
lover was the cherished wish of every woman&rsquo;s
heart; and among them all the king grew quite bewildered.
He wrote down all the answers he received,
and sealed them with his own seal, to give to the churlish
knight when he returned to the Castle of Tarn Wathelan;
but in his own heart King Arthur felt that the true
answer had not yet been given to him. He was sad
as he turned and rode towards the giant&rsquo;s home on New
Year&rsquo;s Day, for he feared to lose his liberty and lands,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg&nbsp;271]</a></span>
and the lonely journey seemed much more dreary than
it had before, when he rode out from Carlisle so full of
hope and courage and self-confidence.</p>


<h3>The Loathly Lady</h3>

<p>Arthur was riding mournfully through a lonely forest
when he heard a woman&rsquo;s voice greeting him: &ldquo;God
save you, King Arthur! God save and keep you!&rdquo;
and he turned at once to see the person who thus
addressed him. He saw no one at all on his right hand,
but as he turned to the other side he perceived a
woman&rsquo;s form clothed in brilliant scarlet; the figure was
seated between a holly-tree and an oak, and the berries
of the former were not more vivid than her dress,
and the brown leaves of the latter not more brown
and wrinkled than her cheeks. At first sight King
Arthur thought he must be bewitched&mdash;no such nightmare
of a human face had ever seemed to him possible.
Her nose was crooked and bent hideously to one side,
while her chin seemed to bend to the opposite side of
her face; her one eye was set deep under her beetling
brow, and her mouth was nought but a gaping slit.
Round this awful countenance hung snaky locks of
ragged grey hair, and she was deadly pale, with a bleared
and dimmed blue eye. The king nearly swooned when
he saw this hideous sight, and was so amazed that he
did not answer her salutation. The loathly lady seemed
angered by the insult: &ldquo;Now Christ save you, King
Arthur! Who are you to refuse to answer my greeting
and take no heed of me? Little of courtesy have you
and your knights in your fine court in Carlisle if you
cannot return a lady&rsquo;s greeting. Yet, Sir King, proud as
you are, it may be that I can help you, loathly though
I be; but I will do nought for one who will not be
courteous to me.&rdquo;</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg&nbsp;272]</a></span></p>

<h3>The Lady&rsquo;s Secret</h3>

<p>King Arthur was ashamed of his lack of courtesy,
and tempted by the hint that here was a woman who
could help him. &ldquo;Forgive me, lady,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I was
sorely troubled in mind, and thus, and not for want of
courtesy, did I miss your greeting. You say that you
can perhaps help me; if you would do this, lady, and
teach me how to pay my ransom, I will grant anything
you ask as a reward.&rdquo; The deformed lady said:
&ldquo;Swear to me, by Holy Rood, and by Mary Mother,
that you will grant me whatever boon I ask, and I will
help you to the secret. Yes, Sir King, I know by secret
means that you seek the answer to the question, &lsquo;What
is it all women most desire?&rsquo; Many women have
given you many replies, but I alone, by my magic
power, can give you the right answer. This secret I
will tell you, and in truth it will pay your ransom,
when you have sworn to keep faith with me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Indeed,
O grim lady, the oath I will take gladly,&rdquo; said
King Arthur; and when he had sworn it, with uplifted
hand, the lady told him the secret, and he vowed with
great bursts of laughter that this was indeed the right
answer.</p>


<h3>The Ransom</h3>

<p>When the king had thoroughly realized the wisdom
of the answer he rode on to the Castle of Tarn Wathelan,
and blew his bugle three times. As it was New
Year&rsquo;s Day, the churlish knight was ready for him,
and rushed forth, club in hand, ready to do battle.
&ldquo;Sir Knight,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;I bring here writings
containing answers to your question; they are replies
that many women have given, and should be right;
these I bring in ransom for my life and lands.&rdquo; The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg&nbsp;273]</a></span>
churlish knight took the writings and read them one
by one, and each one he flung aside, till all had been
read; then he said to the king: &ldquo;You must yield
yourself and your lands to me, King Arthur, and rest
my prisoner; for though these answers be many and
wise, not one is the true reply to my question; your
ransom is not paid, and your life and all you have is
forfeit to me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Alas! Sir Knight,&rdquo; quoth the king,
&ldquo;stay your hand, and let me speak once more before I
yield to you; it is not much to grant to one who risks
life and kingdom and all. Give me leave to try one
more reply.&rdquo; To this the giant assented, and King
Arthur continued: &ldquo;This morning as I rode through
the forest I beheld a lady sitting, clad in scarlet,
between an oak and a holly-tree; she says, &lsquo;All women
will have their own way, and this is their chief desire.&rsquo;
Now confess that I have brought the true answer to
your question, and that I am free, and have paid the
ransom for my life and lands.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The Price of the Ransom</h3>

<p>The giant waxed furious with rage, and shouted: &ldquo;A
curse upon that lady who told you this! It must have
been my sister, for none but she knew the answer.
Tell me, was she ugly and deformed?&rdquo; When King
Arthur replied that she was a loathly lady, the giant
broke out: &ldquo;I vow to heaven that if I can once catch
her I will burn her alive; for she has cheated me of
being King of Britain. Go your ways, Arthur; you
have not ransomed yourself, but the ransom is paid
and you are free.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gladly the king rode back to the forest where the
loathly lady awaited him, and stopped to greet her.
&ldquo;I am free now, lady, thanks to you! What boon do
you ask in reward for your help? I have promised to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg&nbsp;274]</a></span>
grant it you, whatever it may be.&rdquo; &ldquo;This is my boon
King Arthur, that you will bring some young and
courteous knight from your court in Carlisle to marry
me, and he must be brave and handsome too. You
have sworn to fulfil my request, and you cannot break
your word.&rdquo; These last words were spoken as the
king shook his head and seemed on the point of refusing
a request so unreasonable; but at this reminder
he only hung his head and rode slowly away, while the
unlovely lady watched him with a look of mingled pain
and glee.</p>


<h3>King Arthur&rsquo;s Return</h3>

<p>On the second day of the new year King Arthur
came home to Carlisle. Wearily he rode along and dismounted
at the castle, and wearily he went into his
hall, where sat Queen Guenever. She had been very
anxious during her husband&rsquo;s absence, for she dreaded
magic arts, but she greeted him gladly and said: &ldquo;Welcome,
my dear lord and king, welcome home again!
What anxiety I have endured for you! But now you
are here all is well. What news do you bring, my
liege? Is the churlish knight conquered? Where
have you had him hanged, and where is his head?
Placed on a spike above some town-gate? Tell me
your tidings, and we will rejoice together.&rdquo; King
Arthur only sighed heavily as he replied: &ldquo;Alas! I
have boasted too much; the churlish knight was a giant
who has conquered me, and set me free on conditions.&rdquo;
&ldquo;My lord, tell me how this has chanced.&rdquo; &ldquo;His
castle is an enchanted one, standing on enchanted
ground, and surrounded with a circle of magic spells
which sap the bravery from a warrior&rsquo;s mind and the
strength from his arm. When I came on his land and
felt the power of his mighty charms, I was unable to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg&nbsp;275]</a></span>
resist him, but fell into his power, and had to yield
myself to him. He released me on condition that I
would fulfil one thing which he bade me accomplish,
and this I was enabled to do by the help of a loathly
lady; but that help was dearly bought, and I cannot
pay the price myself.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>Sir Gawayne&rsquo;s Devotion</h3>

<p>By this time Sir Gawayne, the king&rsquo;s favourite
nephew, had entered the hall, and greeted his uncle
warmly; then, with a few rapid questions, he learnt
the king&rsquo;s news, and saw that he was in some distress.
&ldquo;What have you paid the loathly lady for her secret,
uncle?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Alas! I have paid her nothing;
but I promised to grant her any boon she asked, and
she has asked a thing impossible.&rdquo; &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
asked Sir Gawayne. &ldquo;Since you have promised it,
the promise must needs be kept. Can I help you to
perform your vow?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, you can, fair nephew
Gawayne, but I will never ask you to do a thing so
terrible,&rdquo; said King Arthur. &ldquo;I am ready to do it,
uncle, were it to wed the loathly lady herself.&rdquo; &ldquo;That
is what she asks, that a fair young knight should marry
her. But she is too hideous and deformed; no man
could make her his wife.&rdquo; &ldquo;If that is all your grief,&rdquo;
replied Sir Gawayne, &ldquo;things shall soon be settled;
I will wed this ill-favoured dame, and will be your
ransom.&rdquo; &ldquo;You know not what you offer,&rdquo; answered
the king. &ldquo;I never saw so deformed a being. Her
speech is well enough, but her face is terrible, with
crooked nose and chin, and she has only one eye.&rdquo;
&ldquo;She must be an ill-favoured maiden; but I heed it
not,&rdquo; said Sir Gawayne gallantly, &ldquo;so that I can save
you from trouble and care.&rdquo; &ldquo;Thanks, dear Gawayne,
thanks a thousand times! Now through your devotion
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg&nbsp;276]</a></span>
I can keep my word. To-morrow we must fetch your
bride from her lonely lodging in the greenwood; but
we will feign some pretext for the journey. I will summon
a hunting party, with horse and hound and gallant
riders, and none shall know that we go to bring home so
ugly a bride.&rdquo; &ldquo;Gramercy, uncle,&rdquo; said Sir Gawayne.
&ldquo;Till to-morrow I am a free man.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The Hunting Party</h3>

<p>The next day King Arthur summoned all the court
to go hunting in the greenwood close to Tarn Wathelan;
but he did not lead the chase near the castle: the
remembrance of his defeat and shame was too strong for
him to wish to see the place again. They roused a
noble stag and chased him far into the forest, where
they lost him amid close thickets of holly and yew interspersed
with oak copses and hazel bushes&mdash;bare were
the hazels, and brown and withered the clinging oak
leaves, but the holly looked cheery, with its fresh green
leaves and scarlet berries. Though the chase had been
fruitless, the train of knights laughed and talked gaily
as they rode back through the forest, and the gayest of
all was Sir Gawayne; he rode wildly down the forest
drives, so recklessly that he drew level with Sir Kay,
the churlish steward, who always preferred to ride alone.
Sir Lancelot, Sir Stephen, Sir Banier, and Sir Bors all
looked wonderingly at the reckless youth; but his
younger brother, Gareth, was troubled, for he knew all
was not well with Gawayne, and Sir Tristram, buried in
his love for Isolde, noticed nothing, but rode heedlessly
wrapped in sad musings.</p>


<h3>Sir Kay and the Loathly Lady</h3>

<p>Suddenly Sir Kay reined up his steed, amazed; his
eye had caught the gleam of scarlet under the trees, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg&nbsp;277]</a></span>
as he looked he became aware of a woman, clad in a
dress of finest scarlet, sitting between a holly-tree and
an oak. &ldquo;Good greeting to you, Sir Kay,&rdquo; said the
lady, but the steward was too much amazed to answer.
Such a face as that of the lady he had never even
imagined, and he took no notice of her salutation.
By this time the rest of the knights had joined him,
and they all halted, looking in astonishment on the misshapen
face of the poor creature before them. It seemed
terrible that a woman&rsquo;s figure should be surmounted by
such hideous features, and most of the knights were silent
for pity&rsquo;s sake; but the steward soon recovered from
his amazement, and his rude nature began to show
itself. The king had not yet appeared, and Sir Kay
began to jeer aloud. &ldquo;Now which of you would fain
woo yon fair lady?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;It takes a brave man,
for methinks he will stand in fear of any kiss he may
get, it must needs be such an awesome thing. But yet
I know not; any man who would kiss this beauteous
damsel may well miss the way to her mouth,
and his fate is not quite so dreadful after all. Come,
who will win a lovely bride!&rdquo; Just then King Arthur
rode up, and at sight of him Sir Kay was silent; but the
loathly lady hid her face in her hands, and wept that he
should pour such scorn upon her.</p>


<h3>The Betrothal</h3>

<p>Sir Gawayne was touched with compassion for this
uncomely woman alone among these gallant and handsome
knights, a woman so helpless and ill-favoured,
and he said: &ldquo;Peace, churl Kay, the lady cannot help
herself; and you are not so noble and courteous that
you have the right to jeer at any maiden; such deeds
do not become a knight of Arthur&rsquo;s Round Table.
Besides, one of us knights here must wed this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg&nbsp;278]</a></span>
unfortunate lady.&rdquo; &ldquo;Wed her?&rdquo; shouted Kay. &ldquo;Gawayne,
you are mad!&rdquo; &ldquo;It is true, is it not, my liege?&rdquo;
asked Sir Gawayne, turning to the king; and Arthur
reluctantly gave token of assent, saying, &ldquo;I promised
her not long since, for the help she gave me in a great
distress, that I would grant her any boon she craved,
and she asked for a young and noble knight to be her
husband. My royal word is given, and I will keep it;
therefore have I brought you here to meet her.&rdquo; Sir
Kay burst out with, &ldquo;What? Ask me perchance to
wed this foul quean? I&rsquo;ll none of her. Where&rsquo;er I
get my wife from, were it from the fiend himself, this
hideous hag shall never be mine.&rdquo; &ldquo;Peace, Sir Kay,&rdquo;
sternly said the king; &ldquo;you shall not abuse this poor
lady as well as refuse her. Mend your speech, or you
shall be knight of mine no longer.&rdquo; Then he turned
to the others and said: &ldquo;Who will wed this lady and
help me to keep my royal pledge? You must not all
refuse, for my promise is given, and for a little ugliness
and deformity you shall not make me break my
plighted word of honour.&rdquo; As he spoke he watched
them keenly, to see who would prove sufficiently
devoted, but the knights all began to excuse themselves
and to depart. They called their hounds, spurred
their steeds, and pretended to search for the track of
the lost stag again; but before they went Sir Gawayne
cried aloud: &ldquo;Friends, cease your strife and debate,
for I will wed this lady myself. Lady, will you have
me for your husband?&rdquo; Thus saying, he dismounted
and knelt before her.</p>


<h3>The Lady&rsquo;s Words</h3>

<p>The poor lady had at first no words to tell her gratitude
to Sir Gawayne, but when she had recovered a
little she spoke: &ldquo;Alas! Sir Gawayne, I fear you do
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg&nbsp;279]</a></span>
but jest. Will you wed with one so ugly and deformed
as I? What sort of wife should I be for a knight so
gay and gallant, so fair and comely as the king&rsquo;s own
nephew? What will Queen Guenever and the ladies of
the Court say when you return to Carlisle bringing
with you such a bride? You will be shamed, and all
through me.&rdquo; Then she wept bitterly, and her weeping
made her seem even more hideous; but King Arthur,
who was watching the scene, said: &ldquo;Lady, I would fain
see that knight or dame who dares mock at my nephew&rsquo;s
bride. I will take order that no such unknightly discourtesy
is shown in my court,&rdquo; and he glared angrily
at Sir Kay and the others who had stayed, seeing that
Sir Gawayne was prepared to sacrifice himself and therefore
they were safe. The lady raised her head and looked
keenly at Sir Gawayne, who took her hand, saying:
&ldquo;Lady, I will be a true and loyal husband to you if you
will have me; and I shall know how to guard my wife
from insult. Come, lady, and my uncle will announce
the betrothal.&rdquo; Now the lady seemed to believe that Sir
Gawayne was in earnest, and she sprang to her feet,
saying: &ldquo;Thanks to you! A thousand thanks, Sir
Gawayne, and blessings on your head! You shall
never rue this wedding, and the courtesy you have
shown. Wend we now to Carlisle.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The Journey to Carlisle</h3>

<p>A horse with a side-saddle had been brought for
Sir Gawayne&rsquo;s bride, but when the lady moved it became
evident that she was lame and halted in her
walk, and there was a slight hunch on her shoulders.
Both of these deformities showed little when she was
seated, but as she moved the knights looked at one
another, shrugged their shoulders and pitied Sir Gawayne,
whose courtesy had bound him for life to so deformed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg&nbsp;280]</a></span>
a wife. Then the whole train rode away together, the
bride between King Arthur and her betrothed, and all
the knights whispering and sneering behind them. Great
was the excitement in Carlisle to see that ugly dame, and
greater still the bewilderment in the court when they
were told that this loathly lady was Sir Gawayne&rsquo;s
bride.</p>


<h3>The Bridal</h3>

<p>Only Queen Guenever understood, and she showed
all courtesy to the deformed bride, and stood by her as
her lady-of-honour when the wedding took place that
evening, while King Arthur was groomsman to his
nephew. When the long banquet was over, and bride and
bridegroom no longer need sit side by side, the tables
were cleared and the hall was prepared for a dance, and
then men thought that Sir Gawayne would be free for
a time to talk with his friends; but he refused. &ldquo;Bride
and bridegroom must tread the first dance together, if
she wishes it,&rdquo; quoth he, and offered his lady his hand
for the dance. &ldquo;I thank you, sweet husband,&rdquo; said the
grim lady as she took it and moved forward to open
the dance with him; and through the long and stately
measure that followed, so perfect was his dignity, and
the courtesy and grace with which he danced, that no
man dreamt of smiling as the deformed lady moved
clumsily through the figures of the dance.</p>


<h3>Sir Gawayne&rsquo;s Bride</h3>

<p>At last the long evening was over, the last measure
danced, the last wine-cup drained, the bride escorted to
her chamber, the lights out, the guests separated in
their rooms, and Gawayne was free to think of what he
had done, and to consider how he had ruined his whole
hope of happiness. He thought of his uncle&rsquo;s favour,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg&nbsp;281]</a></span>
of the poor lady&rsquo;s gratitude, of the blessing she had
invoked upon him, and he determined to be gentle with
her, though he could never love her as his wife. He
entered the bride-chamber with the feeling of a man
who has made up his mind to endure, and did not even
look towards his bride, who sat awaiting him beside
the fire. Choosing a chair, he sat down and looked sadly
into the glowing embers and spoke no word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you no word for me, husband? Can you
not even give me a glance?&rdquo; asked the lady, and Sir
Gawayne turned his eyes to her where she sat; and
then he sprang up in amazement, for there sat no
loathly lady, no ugly and deformed being, but a maiden
young and lovely, with black eyes and long curls of
dark hair, with beautiful face and tall and graceful
figure. &ldquo;Who are you, maiden?&rdquo; asked Sir Gawayne;
and the fair one replied: &ldquo;I am your wife, whom you
found between the oak and the holly-tree, and whom
you wedded this night.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>Sir Gawayne&rsquo;s Choice</h3>

<p>&ldquo;But how has this marvel come to pass?&rdquo; asked he,
wondering, for the fair maiden was so lovely that he
marvelled that he had not known her beauty even
under that hideous disguise. &ldquo;It is an enchantment
to which I am in bondage,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I am not yet
entirely free from it, but now for a time I may appear
to you as I really am. Is my lord content with his
loving bride?&rdquo; asked she, with a little smile, as she
rose and stood before him. &ldquo;Content!&rdquo; he said, as
he clasped her in his arms. &ldquo;I would not change my
dear lady for the fairest dame in Arthur&rsquo;s court, not
though she were Queen Guenever herself. I am the
happiest knight that lives, for I thought to save my
uncle and help a hapless lady, and I have won my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg&nbsp;282]</a></span>
own happiness thereby. Truly I shall never rue the
day when I wedded you, dear heart.&rdquo; Long they sat
and talked together, and then Sir Gawayne grew weary,
and would fain have slept, but his lady said: &ldquo;Husband,
now a heavy choice awaits you. I am under the
spell of an evil witch, who has given me my own face
and form for half the day, and the hideous appearance
in which you first saw me for the other half. Choose
now whether you will have me fair by day and ugly by
night, or hideous by day and beauteous by night. The
choice is your own.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The Dilemma</h3>

<p>Sir Gawayne was no longer oppressed with sleep;
the choice before him was too difficult. If the lady
remained hideous by day he would have to endure the
taunts of his fellows; if by night, he would be unhappy
himself. If the lady were fair by day other
men might woo her, and he himself would have no
love for her; if she were fair to him alone, his love
would make her look ridiculous before the court and
the king. Nevertheless, acting on the spur of the
moment, he spoke: &ldquo;Oh, be fair to me only&mdash;be
your old self by day, and let me have my beauteous
wife to myself alone.&rdquo; &ldquo;Alas! is that your choice?&rdquo;
she asked. &ldquo;I only must be ugly when all are beautiful,
I must be despised when all other ladies are
admired; I am as fair as they, but I must seem foul
to all men. Is this your love, Sir Gawayne?&rdquo; and
she turned from him and wept. Sir Gawayne was
filled with pity and remorse when he heard her lament,
and began to realize that he was studying his own
pleasure rather than his lady&rsquo;s feelings, and his courtesy
and gentleness again won the upper hand. &ldquo;Dear
love, if you would rather that men should see you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg&nbsp;283]</a></span>
fair, I will choose that, though to me you will be
always as you are now. Be fair before others and
deformed to me alone, and men shall never know that
the enchantment is not wholly removed.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>Sir Gawayne&rsquo;s Decision</h3>

<p>Now the lady looked pleased for a moment, and
then said gravely: &ldquo;Have you thought of the danger
to which a young and lovely lady is exposed in the
court? There are many false knights who would woo
a fair dame, though her husband were the king&rsquo;s
favourite nephew; and who can tell?&mdash;one of them
might please me more than you. Sure I am that many
will be sorry they refused to wed me when they see
me to-morrow morn. You must risk my beauty under
the guard of my virtue and wisdom, if you have me
young and fair.&rdquo; She looked merrily at Sir Gawayne
as she spoke; but he considered seriously for a time,
and then said: &ldquo;Nay, dear love, I will leave the matter
to you and your own wisdom, for you are wiser in this
matter than I. I remit this wholly unto you, to decide
according to your will. I will rest content with whatsoever
you resolve.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The Lady&rsquo;s Story</h3>

<p>Now the fair lady clapped her hands lightly, and
said: &ldquo;Blessings on you, dear Gawayne, my own dear
lord and husband! Now you have released me from
the spell completely, and I shall always be as I am now,
fair and young, till old age shall change my beauty as
he doth that of all mortals. My father was a great duke
of high renown who had but one son and one daughter,
both of us dearly beloved, and both of goodly appearance.
When I had come to an age to be married my
father determined to take a new wife, and he wedded
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg&nbsp;284]</a></span>
a witch-lady. She resolved to rid herself of his two
children, and cast a spell upon us both, whereby I was
transformed from a fair lady into the hideous monster
whom you wedded, and my gallant young brother into
the churlish giant who dwells at Tarn Wathelan. She
condemned me to keep that awful shape until I married
a young and courtly knight who would grant me all
my will. You have done all this for me, and I shall be
always your fond and faithful wife. My brother too
is set free from the spell, and he will become again
one of the truest and most gentle knights alive, though
none can excel my own true knight, Sir Gawayne.&rdquo;</p>

<a name="image_page_282" id="image_page_282"></a>
</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;Now you have released me from the spell completely&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The Surprise of the Knights</h3>

<p>The next morning the knight and his bride descended
to the great hall, where many knights and ladies awaited
them, the former thinking scornfully of the hideous
hag whom Gawayne had wedded, the latter pitying so
young and gallant a knight, tied to a lady so ugly. But
both scorn and pity vanished when all saw the bride.
&ldquo;Who is this fair dame?&rdquo; asked Sir Kay. &ldquo;Where
have you left your ancient bride?&rdquo; asked another, and
all awaited the answer in great bewilderment. &ldquo;This is
the lady to whom I was wedded yester evening,&rdquo; replied
Sir Gawayne. &ldquo;She was under an evil enchantment, which
has vanished now that she has come under the power of a
husband, and henceforth my fair wife will be one of the
most beauteous ladies of King Arthur&rsquo;s court. Further,
my lord King Arthur, this fair lady has assured me that
the churlish knight of Tarn Wathelan, her brother, was
also under a spell, which is now broken, and he will be
once more a courteous and gallant knight, and the
ground on which his fortress stands will have henceforth
no magic power to quell the courage of any knight
alive. Dear liege and uncle, when I wedded yesterday
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg&nbsp;285]</a></span>
the loathly lady I thought only of your happiness, and
in that way I have won my own lifelong bliss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>King Arthur&rsquo;s joy at his nephew&rsquo;s fair hap was great
for he had grieved sorely over Gawayne&rsquo;s miserable
fate, and Queen Guenever welcomed the fair maiden as
warmly as she had the loathly lady, and the wedding
feast was renewed with greater magnificence, as a fitting
end to the Christmas festivities.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV: KING HORN</h2>


<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>MONG the hero-legends which are considered
to be of native English growth and to have
come down to us from the times of the Danish
invasions is the story of King Horn; but although
&ldquo;King Horn,&rdquo; like &ldquo;Havelok the Dane,&rdquo; was originally
a story of Viking raids, it has been so altered that
the Norse element has been nearly obliterated. In all
but the bare circumstances of the tale, &ldquo;King Horn&rdquo;
is a romance of chivalry, permeated with the Crusading
spirit, and reflecting the life and customs of the thirteenth
century, instead of the more barbarous manners
of the eighth or ninth centuries. The hero&rsquo;s desire to
obtain knighthood and do some deed worthy of the
honour, the readiness to leave his betrothed for long
years at the call of honour or duty, the embittered
feeling against the Saracens, are all typical of the
romance of the Crusades. Another curious point
which shows a later than Norse influence is the wooing
of the reluctant youth by the princess, of which there
are many instances in medi&aelig;val literature; it reveals
a consciousness of feudal rank which did not exist in
early times, and a certain recognition of the privileges
of royal birth which were not granted before the days
of romantic chivalry. King Horn himself is a hero of
the approved chivalric type, whose chief distinguishing
feature is his long indifference to the misfortunes of
the sorely-tried princess to whom he was betrothed.</p>


<h3>The Royal Family of Suddene</h3>

<p>There once lived and ruled in the pleasant land of
Suddene a noble king named Murry, whose fair consort,
Queen Godhild, was the most sweet and gentle
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg&nbsp;287]</a></span>
lady alive, as the king was a pattern of all knightly
virtues. This royal pair had but one child, a son,
named Horn, now twelve years old, who had been
surrounded from his birth with loyal service and true
devotion. He had a band of twelve chosen companions
with whom he shared sports and tasks, pleasures and
griefs, and the little company grew up well trained in
chivalrous exercises and qualities. Childe Horn had
his favourites among the twelve. Athulf was his dearest
friend, a loving and devoted companion; and next to
him in Horn&rsquo;s affection stood Fikenhild, whose outward
show of love covered his inward envy and hatred. In
everything these two were Childe Horn&rsquo;s inseparable
comrades, and it seemed that an equal bond of love
united the three.</p>


<h3>The Saracen Invasion</h3>

<p>One day as King Murry was riding over the cliffs by
the sea with only two knights in attendance he noticed
some unwonted commotion in a little creek not far
from where he was riding, and he at once turned his
horse&rsquo;s head in that direction and galloped down to
the shore. On his arrival in the small harbour he saw
fifteen great ships of strange build, and their crews,
Saracens all armed for war, had already landed, and
were drawn up in warlike array. The odds against the
king were terrible, but he rode boldly to the invaders
and asked: &ldquo;What brings you strangers here? Why
have you sought our land?&rdquo; A Saracen leader,
gigantic of stature, spoke for them all and replied:
&ldquo;We are here to win this land to the law of Mahomet
and to drive out the Christian law. We will slay all
the inhabitants that believe on Christ. Thou thyself
shalt be our first conquest, for thou shalt not leave
this place alive.&rdquo; Thereupon the Saracens attacked
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg&nbsp;288]</a></span>
the little band, and though the three Christians fought
valiantly they were soon slain. The Saracens then
spread over the land, slaying, burning, and pillaging,
and forcing all who loved their lives to renounce the
Christian faith and become followers of Mahomet.
When Queen Godhild heard of her husband&rsquo;s death
and saw the ruin of her people she fled from her
palace and all her friends and betook herself to a
solitary cave, where she lived unknown and undiscovered,
and continued her Christian worship while
the land was overrun with pagans. Ever she prayed
that God would protect her dear son, and bring him
at last to his father&rsquo;s throne.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">Queen Godhild prays ever for her son Horn</p>


<h3>Horn&rsquo;s Escape</h3>

<p>Soon after the king&rsquo;s death the Saracens had captured
Childe Horn and his twelve comrades, and the boys
were brought before the pagan emir. They would all
have been slain at once or flayed alive, but for the
beauty of Childe Horn, for whose sake their lives were
spared. The old emir looked keenly at the lads, and
said: &ldquo;Horn, thou art a bold and valiant youth, of
great stature for thine age, and of full strength, yet I
know thou hast not yet reached thy full growth. If
we release thee with thy companions, in years to come
we shall dearly rue it, for ye will become great champions
of the Christian law and will slay many of us.
Therefore ye must die. But we will not slay you with
our own hands, for ye are noble lads, and shall have
one feeble chance for your lives. Ye shall be placed in
a boat and driven out to sea, and if ye all are drowned
we shall not grieve overmuch. Either ye must die or
we, for I know we shall dearly abide your king&rsquo;s death
if ye youths survive.&rdquo; Thereupon the lads were all
taken to the shore, and, weeping and lamenting, were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg&nbsp;289]</a></span>
thrust into a rudderless boat, which was towed out to
sea and left helpless.</p>


<h3>Arrival in Westernesse</h3>

<p>The other boys sat lamenting and bewailing their
fate, but Childe Horn, looking round the boat, found a
pair of oars, and as he saw that the boat was in the
grasp of some strong current he rowed in the same
direction, so that the boat soon drifted out of sight of
land. The other lads were a dismal crew, for they
thought their death was certain, but Horn toiled hard
at his rowing all night, and with the dawn grew so
weary that he rested for a little on his oars. When the
rising sun made things clear, and he could see over the
crests of the waves, he stood up in the boat and uttered
a cry of joy. &ldquo;Comrades,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;dear friends, I
see land not far away. I hear the sweet songs of birds
and see the soft green grass. We have come to some
unknown land and have saved our lives.&rdquo; Then
Athulf took up the glad tidings and began to cheer the
forlorn little crew, and under Horn&rsquo;s skilful guidance
the little boat grounded gently and safely on the sands
of Westernesse. The boys sprang on shore, all but
Childe Horn having no thought of the past night and
the journey; but he stood by the boat, looking sadly
at it.</p>


<h3>Farewell to the Boat</h3>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Boat,&rsquo; quoth he, &lsquo;which hast borne me on my way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have thou good days beside a summer sea!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May never wave prevail to sink thee deep!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go, little boat, and when thou comest home<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Greet well my mother, mournful Queen Godhild;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell her, frail skiff, her dear son Horn is safe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Greet, too, the pagan lord, Mahomet&rsquo;s thrall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bitter enemy of Jesus Christ,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg&nbsp;290]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And bid him know that I am safe and well.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say I have reached a land beyond the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whence, in God&rsquo;s own good time, I will return<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he shall feel my vengeance for my sire.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then sorrowfully he pushed the boat out into the
ocean, and the ebbing tide bore it away, while Horn
and his companions set their faces resolutely towards
the town they could see in the distance.</p>


<h3>King Ailmar and Childe Horn</h3>

<p>As the little band were trudging wearily towards the
town they saw a knight riding towards them, and when
he came nearer they became aware that he must be
some noble of high rank. When he halted and began
to question them, Childe Horn recognised by his tone
and bearing that this must be the king. So indeed it
was, for King Ailmar of Westernesse was one of those
noble rulers who see for themselves the state of their
subjects and make their people happy by free, unrestrained
intercourse with them. When the king saw
the forlorn little company he said: &ldquo;Whence are ye,
fair youths, so strong and comely of body? Never
have I seen so goodly a company of thirteen youths in
the realm of Westernesse. Tell me whence ye come,
and what ye seek.&rdquo; Childe Horn assumed the office
of spokesman, for he was leader by birth, by courage,
and by intellect. &ldquo;We are lads of noble families in
Suddene, sons of Christians and of men of lofty station.
Pagans have taken the land and slain our parents, and
we boys fell into their hands. These heathen have
slain and tortured many Christian men, but they had
pity upon us, and put us into an old boat with no sail
or rudder. So we drifted all night, until I saw your
land at dawn, and our boat came to the shore. Now
we are in your power, and you may do with us what
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg&nbsp;291]</a></span>
you will, but I pray you to have pity on us and to feed
us, that we may not perish utterly.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>Ailmar&rsquo;s Decision</h3>

<p>King Ailmar was touched as greatly by the simple
boldness of the spokesman as by the hapless plight of
the little troop, and he answered, smiling: &ldquo;Thou shalt
have nought but help and comfort, fair youth. But, I
pray thee, tell me thy name.&rdquo; Horn answered
readily: &ldquo;King, may all good betide thee! I am
named Horn, and I have come journeying in a boat on
the sea&mdash;now I am here in thy land.&rdquo; King Ailmar replied:
&ldquo;Horn! That is a good name: mayst thou well
enjoy it. Loud may this Horn sound over hill and
dale till the blast of so mighty a Horn shall be heard
in many lands from king to king, and its beauty and
strength be known in many countries. Horn, come
thou with me and be mine, for I love thee and will not
forsake thee.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>Childe Horn at Court</h3>

<p>The king rode home, and all the band of stranger
youths followed him on foot, but for Horn he ordered
a horse to be procured, so that the lad rode by his side;
and thus they came back to the court. When they
entered the hall he summoned his steward, a noble old
knight named Athelbrus, and gave the lads in charge to
him, saying, &ldquo;Steward, take these foundlings of mine,
and train them well in the duties of pages, and later of
squires. Take especial care with the training of Childe
Horn, their chief; let him learn all thy knowledge of
woodcraft and fishing, of hunting and hawking, of harping
and singing; teach him how to carve before me,
and to serve the cup solemnly at banquets; make him
thy favourite pupil and train him to be a knight as good
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg&nbsp;292]</a></span>
as thyself. His companions thou mayst put into other
service, but Horn shall be my own page, and afterwards
my squire.&rdquo; Athelbrus obeyed the king&rsquo;s command,
and the thirteen youths soon found themselves set to
learn the duties of court life, and showed themselves
apt scholars, especially Childe Horn, who did his best
to satisfy the king and his steward on every point.</p>


<h3>The Princess Rymenhild</h3>

<p>When Childe Horn had been at court for six years,
and was now a squire, he became known to all courtiers,
and all men loved him for his gentle courtesy and his
willingness to do any service. King Ailmar made no
secret of the fact that Horn was his favourite squire,
and the Princess Rymenhild, the king&rsquo;s fair daughter,
loved him with all her heart. She was the heir to the
throne, and no man had ever gainsaid her will, and now
it seemed to her unreasonable that she should not be
allowed to wed a good and gallant youth whom she
loved. It was difficult for her to speak alone with him,
for she had six maiden attendants who waited on her
continually, and Horn was engaged with his duties
either in the hall, among the knights, or waiting on the
king. The difficulties only seemed to increase her
love, and she grew pale and wan, and looked miserable.
It seemed to her that if she waited longer her
love would never be happy, and in her impatience she
took a bold step.</p>


<h3>Athelbrus Deceives the Princess</h3>

<p>She kept her chamber, called a messenger, and said
to him: &ldquo;Go quickly to Athelbrus the steward, and bid
him come to me at once. Tell him to bring with him
the squire Childe Horn, for I am lying ill in my room,
and would be amused. Say I expect them quickly, for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg&nbsp;293]</a></span>
I am sad in mind, and have need of cheerful converse.&rdquo;
The messenger bowed, and, withdrawing, delivered the
message exactly as he had received it to Athelbrus, who
was much perplexed thereby. He wondered whence
came this sudden illness, and what help Childe Horn
could give. It was an unusual thing for the squire to be
asked into a lady&rsquo;s bower, and still more so into that of
a princess, and Athelbrus had already felt some suspicion
as to the sentiments of the royal lady towards
the gallant young squire. Considering all these things,
the cautious steward deemed it safer not to expose
young Horn to the risks that might arise from such an
interview, and therefore induced Athulf to wait upon
the princess and to endeavour to personate his more
distinguished companion. The plan succeeded beyond
expectation in the dimly lighted room, and the infatuated
princess soon startled the unsuspecting squire by a warm
and unreserved declaration of her affection. Recovering
from his natural amazement, he modestly disclaimed a
title to the royal favour and acknowledged his identity.</p>

<p>On discovering her mistake the princess was torn by
conflicting emotions, but finally relieved the pressure
of self-reproach and the confusion of maiden modesty
by overwhelming the faithful steward with denunciation
and upbraiding, until at last, in desperation, the poor
man promised, against his better judgment, to bring
about a meeting between his love-lorn mistress and the
favoured squire.</p>


<h3>Athelbrus Summons Horn</h3>

<p>When Rymenhild understood that Athelbrus would
fulfil her desire she was very glad and joyous; her
sorrow was turned into happy expectation, and she
looked kindly upon the old steward as she said: &ldquo;Go
now quickly, and send him to me in the afternoon.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg&nbsp;294]</a></span>
The king will go to the wood for sport and pastime, and
Horn can easily remain behind; then he can stay with
me till my father returns at eve. No one will betray
us; and when I have met my beloved I care not what
men may say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the steward went down to the banqueting-hall,
where he found Childe Horn fulfilling his duties
as cup-bearer, pouring out and tasting the red wine in
the king&rsquo;s golden goblet. King Ailmar asked many
questions about his daughter&rsquo;s health, and when he learnt
that her malady was much abated he rose in gladness
from the table and summoned his courtiers to go with
him into the greenwood. Athelbrus bade Horn tarry,
and when the gay throng had passed from the hall the
steward said gravely: &ldquo;Childe Horn, fair and courteous,
my beloved pupil, go now to the bower of the Princess
Rymenhild, and stay there to fulfil all her commands.
It may be thou shalt hear strange things, but keep rash
and bold words in thy heart, and let them not be upon
thy tongue. Horn, dear lad, be true and loyal now,
and thou shalt never repent it.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>Horn and Rymenhild</h3>

<p>Horn listened to this unusual speech with great
astonishment, but, since Sir Athelbrus spoke so solemnly,
he laid all his words to heart, and thus, marvelling
greatly, departed to the royal bower. When he had
knocked at the door, and had been bidden to come in,
entering, he found Rymenhild sitting in a great chair,
intently regarding him as he came into the room. He
knelt down to make obeisance to her, and kissed her
hand, saying, &ldquo;Sweet be thy life and soft thy slumbers,
fair Princess Rymenhild! Well may it be with thy
gentle ladies of honour! I am here at thy command,
lady, for Sir Athelbrus the steward, bade me come to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg&nbsp;295]</a></span>
speak with thee. Tell me thy will, and I will fulfil all
thy desires.&rdquo; She arose from her seat, and, bending
towards him as he knelt, took him by the hand and
lifted him up, saying, &ldquo;Arise and sit beside me, Childe
Horn, and we will drink this cup of wine together.&rdquo;
In great astonishment the youth did as the princess
bade, and sat beside her, and soon, to his utter
amazement, Rymenhild avowed her love for him, and
offered him her hand. &ldquo;Have pity on me, Horn, and
plight me thy troth, for in very truth I love thee,
and have loved thee long, and if thou wilt I will be thy
wife.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>Horn Refuses the Princess</h3>

<p>Now Horn was in evil case, for he saw full well
in what danger he would place the princess, Sir
Athelbrus, and himself if he accepted the proffer of
her love. He knew the reason of the steward&rsquo;s
warning, and tried to think what he might say to
satisfy the princess and yet not be disloyal to the
king. At last he replied: &ldquo;Christ save and keep
thee, my lady Rymenhild, and give thee joy of thy
husband, whosoever he may be! I am too lowly
born to be worthy of such a wife; I am a mere
foundling, living on thy father&rsquo;s bounty. It is not
in the course of nature that such as I should wed
a king&rsquo;s daughter, for there can be no equal match
between a princess and a landless squire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rymenhild was so disheartened and ashamed at this
reply to her loving appeal that her colour changed, she
turned deadly pale, began to sigh, flung her arms out
wildly, and fell down in a swoon. Childe Horn lifted
her up, full of pity for her deep distress, and began to
comfort her and try to revive her. As he held her in
his arms he kissed her often, and said:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg&nbsp;296]</a></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Lady, dear love, take comfort and be strong!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I will yield me wholly to thy guidance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thou wilt compass one great thing for me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plead with King Ailmar that he dub me knight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I may prove me worthy of thy love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon shall my knighthood be no idle dream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I will strive to do thy will, dear heart.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now at these words Rymenhild awoke from her
swoon, and made him repeat his promise. She said:
&ldquo;Ah! Horn, that shall speedily be done. Ere the
week is past thou shalt be Sir Horn, for my father
loves thee, and will grant the dignity most willingly to
one so dear to him. Go now quickly to Sir Athelbrus,
give him as a token of my gratitude this golden goblet
and this ring; pray him that he persuade the king to
dub thee knight. I will repay him with rich rewards
for his gentle courtesy to me. May Christ help him to
speed thee in thy desires!&rdquo; Horn then took leave of
Rymenhild with great affection, and found Athelbrus,
to whom he delivered the gifts and the princess&rsquo;s
message, which the steward received with due reverence.</p>


<h3>Horn Becomes a Knight</h3>

<p>This plan seemed to Athelbrus very good, for it
raised Horn to be a member of the noble Order of
Knights, and would give him other chances of distinguishing
himself. Accordingly he went to the king as
he sat over the evening meal, and spoke thus: &ldquo;Sir
King, hear my words, for I have counsel for thee.
To-morrow is the festival of thy birth, and the whole
realm of Westernesse must rejoice in its master&rsquo;s joy.
Wear thou thy crown in solemn state, and I think it
were nought amiss if thou shouldst knight young
Horn, who will become a worthy defender of thy
throne.&rdquo; &ldquo;That were well done,&rdquo; said King Ailmar.
&ldquo;The youth pleases me, and I will knight him with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg&nbsp;297]</a></span>
my own sword. Afterwards he shall knight his twelve
comrades the same day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day the ceremony of knighting was performed
with all solemnity, and at its close a great
banquet was prepared and all men made merry. But
Princess Rymenhild was somewhat sad. She could
not descend to the hall and take her customary place,
for this was a feast for knights alone, and she would
not be without her betrothed one moment longer, so
she sent a messenger to fetch Sir Horn to her bower.</p>


<h3>Horn and Athulf Go to Rymenhild</h3>

<p>Now that Horn was a newly dubbed knight he
would not allow the slightest shadow of dishonour
to cloud his conduct; accordingly, when he obeyed
Rymenhild&rsquo;s summons he was accompanied by Athulf.
&ldquo;Welcome, Sir Horn and Sir Athulf,&rdquo; she cried,
holding out her hands in greeting. &ldquo;Love, now that
thou hast thy will, keep thy plighted word and make
me thy wife; release me from my anxiety and do as
thou hast said.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Dear Rymenhild, hold thou thyself at peace,&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quoth young Sir Horn; &lsquo;I will perform my vow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But first I must ride forth to prove my might;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must conquer hardships, and my own worse self,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere I can hope to woo and wed my bride.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We are but new-fledged knights of one day&rsquo;s growth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet we know the custom of our state<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is first to fight and win a hero&rsquo;s name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then afterwards to win a lady&rsquo;s heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This day will I do bravely for thy love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And show my valour and my deep devotion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In prowess &rsquo;gainst the foes of this thy land.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I come back in peace, I claim my wife.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Rymenhild protested no longer, for she saw that
where honour was concerned Horn was inflexible.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg&nbsp;298]</a></span>
&ldquo;My true knight,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I must in sooth believe
thee, and I feel that I may. Take this ring engraved
with my name, wrought by the most skilled worker of
our court, and wear it always, for it has magic virtues.
The gems are of such saving power that thou shalt fear
no strokes in battle, nor ever be cast down if thou gaze
on this ring and think of thy love. Athulf, too, shall
have a similar ring. And now, Horn, I commend thee
to God, and may Christ give thee good success and
bring thee back in safety!&rdquo;</p>


<h3>Horn&rsquo;s First Exploit</h3>

<p>After taking an affectionate farewell of Rymenhild,
Horn went down to the hall, and, seeing all the other
new-made knights going in to the banquet, he slipped
quietly away and betook himself to the stables. There
he armed himself secretly and mounted his white
charger, which pranced and reared joyfully as he rode
away; and Horn began to sing for joy of heart, for he
had won his chief desire, and was happy in the love of
the king&rsquo;s daughter. As he rode by the shore he saw
a stranger ship drawn up on the beach, and recognised
the banner and accoutrements of her Saracen crew, for he
had never forgotten the heathens who had slain his father.
&ldquo;What brings you here?&rdquo; he asked angrily, and as
fearlessly as King Murry had done, and received the
same answer: &ldquo;We will conquer this land and slay the
inhabitants.&rdquo; Then Horn&rsquo;s anger rose, he gripped his
sword, and rushed boldly at the heathens, and slew
many of them, striking off a head at each blow. The
onslaught was so sudden that the Saracens were taken
by surprise at first, but then they rallied and surrounded
Horn, so that matters began to look dangerous for him.
Then he remembered the betrothal ring, and looked on
it, thinking earnestly of Rymenhild, his dear love, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg&nbsp;299]</a></span>
such courage came to him that he was able to defeat
the pagans and slay their leader. The others, sorely
wounded&mdash;for none escaped unhurt&mdash;hurried on board
ship and put to sea, and Horn, bearing the Saracen
leader&rsquo;s head on his sword&rsquo;s point, rode back to the
royal palace. Here he related to King Ailmar this
first exploit of his knighthood, and presented the head
of the foe to the king, who rejoiced greatly at Horn&rsquo;s
valour and success.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">Horn kills the Saracen leader</p>


<h3>Rymenhild&rsquo;s Dream</h3>

<p>The next day the king and all the court rode out
hunting, but Horn made an excuse to stay behind with
the princess, and the false and wily Fikenhild was also
left at home, and he crept secretly to Rymenhild&rsquo;s
bower to spy on her. She was sitting weeping bitterly
when Sir Horn entered. He was amazed. &ldquo;Love, for
mercy&rsquo;s sake, why weepest thou so sorely?&rdquo; he asked;
and she replied: &ldquo;I have had a mournful dream. I
dreamt that I was casting a net and had caught a great
fish, which began to burst the net. I greatly fear that
I shall lose my chosen fish.&rdquo; Then she looked sadly at
Horn. But the young knight was in a cheery mood,
and replied: &ldquo;May Christ and St. Stephen turn thy
dream to good! If I am thy fish, I will never deceive
thee nor do aught to displease thee, and hereto I plight
thee my troth. But I would rather interpret thy dream
otherwise. This great fish which burst thy net is
some one who wishes us ill, and will do us harm soon.&rdquo;
Yet in spite of Horn&rsquo;s brave words it was a sad
betrothal, for Rymenhild wept bitterly, and her lover
could not stop her tears.</p>


<h3>Fikenhild&rsquo;s False Accusation</h3>

<p>Fikenhild had listened to all their conversation with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg&nbsp;300]</a></span>
growing envy and anger, and now he stole away silently,
and met King Ailmar returning from the chase.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;King Ailmar,&rsquo; said the false one, &lsquo;see, I bring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A needed warning, that thou guard thyself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Horn will take thy life; I heard him vow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To slay thee, or by sword or fire, this night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thou demand what cause of hate he has,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Know that the villain wooes thine only child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair Rymenhild, and hopes to wear thy crown.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E&rsquo;en now he tarries in the maiden&rsquo;s bower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he has often done, and talks with her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With guileful tongue, and cunning show of love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unless thou banish him thou art not safe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In life or honour, for he knows no law.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The king at first refused to believe the envious
knight&rsquo;s report, but, going to Rymenhild&rsquo;s bower, he
found apparent confirmation, for Horn was comforting
the princess, and promising to wed her when he should
have done worthy feats of arms. The king&rsquo;s wrath
knew no bounds, and with words of harsh reproach he
banished Horn at once, on pain of death. The young
knight armed himself quickly and returned to bid
farewell to his betrothed.</p>


<h3>Horn&rsquo;s Banishment</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Dear heart,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;now thy dream has come
true, and thy fish must needs break the net and be
gone. The enemy whom I foreboded has wrought us
woe. Farewell, mine own dear Rymenhild; I may no
longer stay, but must wander in alien lands. If I do
not return at the end of seven years take thyself a husband
and tarry no longer for me. And now take me
in your arms and kiss me, dear love, ere I go!&rdquo; So
they kissed each other and bade farewell, and Horn
called to him his comrade Athulf, saying, &ldquo;True and
faithful friend, guard well my dear love. Thou hast
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg&nbsp;301]</a></span>
never forsaken me; now do thou keep Rymenhild for
me.&rdquo; Then he rode away, and, reaching the haven,
hired a good ship and sailed for Ireland, where he took
service with King Thurston, under the name of Cuthbert.
In Ireland he became sworn brother to the
king&rsquo;s two sons, Harold and Berild, for they loved him
from the first moment they saw him, and were in no
way jealous of his beauty and valour.</p>


<h3>Horn Slays the Giant Emir</h3>

<p>When Christmas came, and King Thurston sat at the
banquet with all his lords, at noontide a giant strode
into the hall, bearing a message of defiance. He came
from the Saracens, and challenged any three Irish knights
to fight one Saracen champion. If the Irish won the
pagans would withdraw from Ireland; if the Irish
chiefs were slain the Saracens would hold the land.
The combat was to be decided the next day at dawn.
King Thurston accepted the challenge, and named
Harold, Berild, and Cuthbert (as Horn was called) as
the Christian champions, because they were the best
warriors in Ireland; but Horn begged permission to
speak, and said: &ldquo;Sir King, it is not right that one man
should fight against three, and one heathen hound think
to resist three Christian warriors. I will fight and conquer
him alone, for I could as easily slay three of them.&rdquo;
At last the king allowed Horn to attempt the combat
alone, and spent the night in sorrowful musing on the
result of the contest, while Horn slept well and arose
and armed himself cheerily. He then aroused the
king, and the Irish troop rode out to a fair and level
green lawn, where they found the emir with many
companions awaiting them. The combat began at
once, and Horn gave blows so mighty that the pagan
onlookers fell swooning through very fear, till Horn
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg&nbsp;302]</a></span>
said: &ldquo;Now, knights, rest for a time, if it pleases you.&rdquo;
Then the Saracens spoke together, saying aloud that no
man had ever so daunted them before except King
Murry of Suddene.</p>

<p>This mention of his dead father aroused Horn, who
now realized that he saw before him his father&rsquo;s
murderers. His anger was kindled, he looked at his
ring and thought of Rymenhild, and then, drawing his
sword again, he rushed at the heathen champion. The
giant fell pierced through the heart, and his companions
fled to their ships, hotly pursued by Horn and his
company. Much fighting there was, and in the hot
strife near the ships the king&rsquo;s two sons, Harold and
Berild, were both slain.</p>


<h3>Horn Refuses the Throne</h3>

<p>Sadly they were laid on a bier and brought back
to the palace, their sorrowful father lamenting their
early death; and when he had wept his fill the mournful
king came into the hall where all his knights silently
awaited him. Slowly he came up to Horn as he sat a
little apart from the rest, and said: &ldquo;Cuthbert, wilt
thou fulfil my desire? My heirs are slain, and thou
art the best knight in Ireland for strength and beauty
and valour; I implore thee to wed Reynild, my only
daughter (now, alas! my only child), and to rule my
realm. Wilt thou do so, and lift the burden of my
cares from my weary shoulders?&rdquo; But Horn replied:
&ldquo;O Sir King, it were wrong for me to receive thy fair
daughter and heir and rule thy realm, as thou dost
offer. I shall do thee yet better service, my liege,
before I die; and I know that thy grief will change ere
seven years have passed away. When that time is
over, Sir King, give me my reward: thou shalt not
refuse me thy daughter when I desire her.&rdquo; To this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg&nbsp;303]</a></span>
King Thurston agreed, and Horn dwelt in Ireland for
seven years, and sent no word or token to Rymenhild
all the time.</p>


<h3>Rymenhild&rsquo;s Distress</h3>

<p>In the meantime Princess Rymenhild was in great
perplexity and trouble, for a powerful ruler, King Modi
of Reynes, wooed her for his wife, and her own betrothed
sent her no token of his life or love. Her
father accepted the new suitor for her hand, and the
day of the wedding was fixed, so that Rymenhild could
no longer delay her marriage. In her extremity she
besought Athulf to write letters to Horn, begging him
to return and claim his bride and protect her; and
these letters she delivered to several messengers, bidding
them search in all lands until they found Sir Horn
and gave the letters into his own hand. Horn knew
nought of this, till one day in the forest he met a weary
youth, all but exhausted, who told how he had sought
Horn in vain. When Horn declared himself, the
youth broke out into loud lamentations over Rymenhild&rsquo;s
unhappy fate, and delivered the letter which
explained all her distress. Now it was Horn&rsquo;s turn to
weep bitterly for his love&rsquo;s troubles, and he bade the
messenger return to his mistress and tell her to cease
her tears, for Horn would be there in time to rescue
her from her hated bridegroom. The youth returned
joyfully, but as his boat neared the shore of Westernesse
a storm arose and the messenger was drowned;
so that Rymenhild, opening her tower door to look for
expected succour, found her messenger lying dead at
the foot of the tower, and felt that all hope was gone.
She wept and wrung her hands, but nothing that she
could do would avert the evil day.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg&nbsp;304]</a></span></p>

<h3>Horn and King Thurston</h3>

<p>As soon as Horn had read Rymenhild&rsquo;s letter he
went to King Thurston and revealed the whole matter
to him. He told of his own royal parentage, his exile,
his knighthood, his betrothal to the princess, and his
banishment; then of the death of the Saracen leader
who had slain King Murry, and the vengeance he had
taken. Then he ended:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;King Thurston, be thou wise, and grant my boon;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Repay the service I have yielded thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Help me to save my princess from this woe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will take counsel for fair Reynild&rsquo;s fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For she shall wed Sir Athulf, my best friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My truest comrade and my doughtiest knight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If ever I have risked my life for thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And proved myself in battle, grant my prayer.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>To this the king replied: &ldquo;Childe Horn, do what
thou wilt.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>Horn Returns on the Wedding-day</h3>

<p>Horn at once invited Irish knights to accompany him
to Westernesse to rescue his love from a hateful marriage,
and many came eagerly to fight in the cause of
the valiant Cuthbert who had defended Ireland for
seven years. Thus it was with a goodly company that
Horn took ship, and landed in King Ailmar&rsquo;s realm;
and he came in a happy hour, for it was the wedding-day
of Princess Rymenhild and King Modi of Reynes.
The Irish knights landed and encamped in a wood,
while Horn went on alone to learn tidings. Meeting a
palmer, he asked the news, and the palmer replied: &ldquo;I
have been at the wedding of Princess Rymenhild, and
a sad sight it was, for the bride was wedded against her
will, vowing she had a husband though he is a banished
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg&nbsp;305]</a></span>
man. She would take no ring nor utter any vows; but
the service was read, and afterwards King Modi took
her to a strong castle, where not even a palmer was
given entrance. I came away, for I could not endure
the pity of it. The bride sits weeping sorely, and if
report be true her heart is like to break with grief.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>Horn Is Disguised as a Palmer</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Come, palmer,&rdquo; said Horn, &ldquo;lend me your cloak
and scrip. I must see this strange bridal, and it may
be I shall make some there repent of the wrong they
have done to a helpless maiden. I will essay to enter.&rdquo;
The change was soon made, and Horn darkened his
face and hands as if bronzed with Eastern suns, bowed
his back, and gave his voice an old man&rsquo;s feebleness, so
that no man would have known him; which done, he
made his way to King Modi&rsquo;s new castle. Here he
begged admittance for charity&rsquo;s sake, that he might
share the broken bits of the wedding feast; but he was
churlishly refused by the porter, who would not be
moved by any entreaties. At last Horn lost all patience,
and broke open the door, and threw the porter out
over the drawbridge into the moat; then, once more
assuming his disguise, he made his way into the hall
and sat down in the beggars&rsquo; row.</p>


<h3>The Recognition</h3>

<p>Rymenhild was weeping still, and her stern husband
seemed only angered by her tears. Horn looked about
cautiously, but saw no sign of Athulf, his trusted
comrade; for he was at this time eagerly looking for
his friend&rsquo;s coming from the lofty watch-tower, and
lamenting that he could guard the princess no longer.
At last, when the banquet was nearly over, Rymenhild
rose to pour out wine for the guests, as the custom was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg&nbsp;306]</a></span>
then; and she bore a horn of ale or wine along the
benches to each person there. Horn, sitting humbly
on the ground, called out: &ldquo;Come, courteous Queen,
turn to me, for we beggars are thirsty folk.&rdquo; Rymenhild
smiled sadly, and, setting down the horn, filled a
bowl with brown ale, for she thought him a drunkard.
&ldquo;Here, drink this, and more besides, if thou wilt; I
never saw so bold a beggar,&rdquo; she said. But Horn
refused. He handed the bowl to the other beggars,
and said: &ldquo;Lady, I will drink nought but from a silver
cup, for I am not what you think me. I am no beggar,
but a fisher, come from afar to fish at thy wedding feast.
My net lies near by, and has lain there for seven years,
and I am come to see if it has caught any fish. Drink
to me, and drink to Horn from thy horn, for far have
I journeyed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the palmer spoke of fishing, and his seven-year-old
net, Rymenhild felt cold at heart; she did
not recognise him, but wondered greatly when he bade
her drink &ldquo;to Horn.&rdquo; She filled her cup and gave it
to the palmer, saying, &ldquo;Drink thy fill, and then tell
me if thou hast ever seen Horn in thy wanderings.&rdquo;
As the palmer drank, he dropped his ring into the cup;
then he returned it to Rymenhild, saying, &ldquo;Queen,
seek out what is in thy draught.&rdquo; She said nothing
then, but left the hall with her maidens and went to
her bower, where she found the well-remembered ring
she had given to Horn in token of betrothal. Greatly
she feared that Horn was dead, and sent for the palmer,
whom she questioned as to whence he had got the ring.</p>


<h3>Horn&rsquo;s Stratagem</h3>

<p>Horn thought he would test her love for him, since
she had not recognised him, so he replied: &ldquo;By
St. Giles, lady, I have wandered many a mile, far
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg&nbsp;307]</a></span>
into realms of the West, and there I found Sir Horn
ready prepared to sail home to your land. He told
me that he planned to reach the realm of Westernesse
in time to see you before seven years had passed, and I
embarked with him. The winds were favourable and we
had a quick voyage, but, alas! he fell ill and died. When
he lay dying he begged me piteously, &lsquo;Take this ring,
from which I have never been parted, to my dear lady
Rymenhild,&rsquo; and he kissed it many times and pressed it to
his breast. May God give his soul rest in Paradise!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Rymenhild heard those terrible tidings she
sighed deeply and said: &ldquo;O heart, burst now, for thou
shalt never more have Horn, for love of whom thou
hast been tormented so sorely!&rdquo; Then she fell upon
her bed, and grasped the dagger which she had concealed
there; for if Horn did not come in time she
had planned to slay both her hateful lord and herself
that very night. Now, in her misery, she set the dagger
to her heart, and would have slain herself at once, had
not the palmer interrupted her. Rushing forward, he
exclaimed: &ldquo;Dear Queen and lady, I am Horn, thine
own true love. Dost thou not recognise me? I am
Childe Horn of Westernesse. Take me in thy arms,
dear love, and kiss me welcome home.&rdquo; As Rymenhild
stared incredulously at him, letting the dagger fall from
her trembling hand, he hurriedly cast away his disguise,
brushed off the disfiguring stain he had put on his
cheeks, and stood up straight and strong, her own noble
knight and lover. What joy they had together! How
they told each other of all their adventures and troubles,
and how they embraced and kissed each other!</p>


<h3>Horn Slays King Modi</h3>

<p>When their joy had become calmer, Horn said to his
lady: &ldquo;Dear Rymenhild, I must leave thee now, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg&nbsp;308]</a></span>
return to my knights, who are encamped in the forest.
Within an hour I will return to the feast and give
the king and his guests a stern lesson.&rdquo; Then he flung
away the palmer&rsquo;s cloak, and went forth in knightly
array; while the princess went up to the watch-tower,
where Athulf still scanned the sea for some sign of
Horn&rsquo;s coming. Rymenhild said: &ldquo;Sir Athulf, true
friend, go quickly to Horn, for he has arrived, and
with him he brings a great army.&rdquo; The knight gladly
hastened to the courtyard, mounted his steed, and soon
overtook Horn. They were greatly rejoiced to meet
again, and had much to tell each other and to plan for
that day&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p>In the evening Horn and his army reached the castle,
where they found the gates undone for them by their
friends within, and in a short but desperate conflict
King Modi and all the guests at the banquet were
slain, except Rymenhild, her father, and Horn&rsquo;s twelve
comrades. Then a new wedding was celebrated, for
King Ailmar durst not refuse his daughter to the
victor, and the bridal was now one of real rejoicing,
though the king was somewhat bitter of mood.</p>


<h3>Horn&rsquo;s Departure</h3>

<p>When the hours wore on to midnight, Horn, sitting
beside his bride, called for silence in the hall, and
addressed the king thus: &ldquo;Sir King, I pray thee listen
to my tale, for I have much to say and much to explain.
My name is in sooth Horn, and I am the son of King
Murry of Suddene, who was slain by the Saracens.
Thou didst cherish me and give me knighthood, and I
proved myself a true knight on the very day when
I was dubbed. Thou didst love me then, but evil
men accused me to thee and I was banished. For seven
years I have lived in a strange land; but now that I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg&nbsp;309]</a></span>
have returned, I have won thy fair daughter as my
bride. But I cannot dwell here in idleness while the
heathen hold my father&rsquo;s land. I vow by the Holy
Rood that I will not rest, and will not claim my wife,
until I have purified Suddene from the infidel invaders,
and can lay its crown at Rymenhild&rsquo;s feet. Do thou,
O King, guard well my wife till my return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The king consented to this proposal, and, in spite of
Rymenhild&rsquo;s grief, Horn immediately bade her farewell,
and with his whole army embarked for Suddene, this
time accompanied by Athulf, but leaving the rest of his
comrades for the protection of his wife.</p>


<h3>The Apostate Knight</h3>

<p>The wind blew fair for Suddene, and the fleet reached
the port. The warriors disembarked, and marched inland,
to encamp for the night in a wood, where they
could be hidden. Horn and Athulf set out at midnight
to endeavour to obtain news of the foe, and soon found
a solitary knight sleeping. They awoke him roughly,
saying, &ldquo;Knight, awake! Why sleepest thou here?
What dost thou guard?&rdquo; The knight sprang lightly
from the ground, saw their faces and the shining crosses
on their shields, and cast down his eyes in shame, saying,
&ldquo;Alas! I have served these pagans against my will.
In time gone by I was a Christian, but now I am a
coward renegade, who forsook his God for fear of death
at the hands of the Saracens! I hate my infidel masters,
but I fear them too, and they have forced me to guard
this district and keep watch against Horn&rsquo;s return. If
he should come to his own again how glad I should
be! These infidels slew his father, and drove him into
exile, with his twelve comrades, among whom was my
own son, Athulf, who loved the prince as his own life.
If the prince is yet alive, and my son also, God grant
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg&nbsp;310]</a></span>
that I may see them both again! Then would I
joyfully die.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The Recognition</h3>

<p>Horn answered quickly: &ldquo;Sir Knight, be glad and
rejoice, for here are we, Horn and Athulf, come to
avenge my father and retake my realm from the
heathen.&rdquo; Athulf&rsquo;s father was overcome with joy and
shame; he hardly dared to embrace his son, yet the
bliss of meeting was so great that he clasped Athulf in
his arms and prayed his forgiveness for the disgrace
he had brought upon him. The two young knights
said nothing of his past weakness, but told him all their
own adventures, and at last he said: &ldquo;What is your true
errand hither? Can you two alone slay the heathen?
Dear Childe Horn, what joy this will be to thy mother
Godhild, who still lives in a solitary retreat, praying for
thee and for the land!&rdquo; Horn broke in on his speech
with &ldquo;Blessed be the hour when I returned! Thank
God that my mother yet lives! We are not alone, but
I have an army of valiant Irish warriors, who will help
me to regain my realm.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The Reconquest of Suddene</h3>

<p>Now the king blew his horn, and his host marched
out from the wood and prepared to attack the Saracens.
The news soon spread that Childe Horn had returned,
and many men who had accepted the faith of Mahomet
for fear of death now threw off the hated religion,
joined the true king&rsquo;s army, and were rebaptized. The
war was not long, for the Saracens had made themselves
universally hated, and the inhabitants rose against
them; so that in a short time the country was purged
of the infidels, who were slain or fled to other lands.
Then Horn brought his mother from her retreat, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg&nbsp;311]</a></span>
together they purified the churches which had been
desecrated, and restored the true faith. When the
land of Suddene was again a Christian realm King
Horn was crowned with solemn rites, and a great
coronation feast was held, which lasted too long for
Horn&rsquo;s true happiness.</p>


<h3>Fikenhild Imprisons Rymenhild</h3>

<p>During Horn&rsquo;s absence from Westernesse, his comrades
watched carefully over Rymenhild; but her father,
who was growing old, had fallen much under the
influence of the plausible Fikenhild. From the day
when Fikenhild had falsely accused Horn to the king,
Ailmar had held him in honour as a loyal servant, and
now he had such power over the old ruler that when
he demanded Rymenhild&rsquo;s hand in marriage, saying
that Horn was dead in Suddene, the king dared not
refuse, and the princess was bidden to make ready for
a new bridal. For this day Fikenhild had long been
prepared; he had built a massive fortress on a promontory,
which at high tide was surrounded by the sea,
but was easy of access at the ebb; thither he now led
the weeping princess, and began a wedding feast which
was to last all day, and to end only with the marriage
ceremony at night.</p>


<h3>Horn&rsquo;s Dream</h3>

<p>That same night, before the feast, King Horn had a
terrible dream. He thought he saw his wife taken
on board ship; soon the ship began to sink, and Rymenhild
held out her hands for rescue, but Fikenhild,
standing in safety on shore, beat her back into the
waves with his sword. With the agony of the sight
Horn awoke, and, calling his comrade Athulf, said:
&ldquo;Friend, we must depart to-day. My wife is in danger
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg&nbsp;312]</a></span>
from false Fikenhild, whom I have trusted too much.
Let us delay no longer, but go at once. If God will,
I hope to release her, and to punish Fikenhild. God
grant we come in time!&rdquo; With some few chosen
knights, King Horn and Athulf set out, and the ship
drove darkling through the sea, they knew not whither.
All the night they drifted on, and in the morning found
themselves beneath a newly built castle, which none of
them had seen before.</p>


<h3>Horn&rsquo;s Disguise</h3>

<p>While they were seeking to moor their boat to the
shore, one of the castle windows looking out to sea
opened, and they saw a knight standing and gazing seaward,
whom they speedily recognised; it was Athulf&rsquo;s
cousin, Sir Arnoldin, one of the twelve comrades, who
had accompanied the princess thither in the hope that
he might yet save her from Fikenhild; he was now
looking, as a forlorn hope, over the sea, though he
believed Horn was dead. His joy was great when he
saw the knights, and he came out to them and speedily
told them of Rymenhild&rsquo;s distress and the position of
affairs in the castle. King Horn was not at a loss for
an expedient even in this distress. He quickly disguised
himself and a few of his comrades as minstrels,
harpers, fiddlers, and jugglers. Then, rowing to the
mainland, he waited till low tide, and made his way
over the beach to the castle, accompanied by his disguised
comrades. Outside the castle walls they began
to play and sing, and Rymenhild heard them, and,
asking what the sounds were, gave orders that the
minstrels should be admitted. They sat on benches
low down the hall, tuning their harps and fiddles
and watching the bride, who seemed unhappy and
pale. When Horn sang a lay of true love and happiness,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg&nbsp;313]</a></span>
Rymenhild swooned for grief, and the king was
touched to the heart with bitter remorse that he had
tried her constancy so long, and had allowed her to
endure such hardships and misery for his sake.</p>

<p class="caption">Horn and his followers disguised as minstrels</p>


<h3>Death of Fikenhild</h3>

<p>King Horn now glanced down and saw the ring of
betrothal on his finger, where he had worn it ever, except
that fateful day when he had given it as a token of
recognition to Rymenhild. He thought of his wife&rsquo;s
sufferings, and his mind was made up. Springing from
the minstrels&rsquo; bench, he strode boldly up the hall,
throwing off his disguise, and, shouting, &ldquo;I am King
Horn! False Fikenhild, thou shalt die!&rdquo; he slew the
villain in the midst of his men. Horn&rsquo;s comrades likewise
flung off their disguise, and soon overpowered the
few of the household who cared to fight in their dead
master&rsquo;s cause. The castle was taken for King Ailmar,
who was persuaded to nominate Sir Arnoldin his heir,
and the baronage of Westernesse did homage to him as
the next king. Horn and his fair wife begged the good
old steward Sir Athelbrus to go with them to Suddene,
and on the way they touched at Ireland, where Reynild,
the king&rsquo;s fair daughter, was induced to look favourably
on Sir Athulf and accept him for her husband. The
land of King Modi, which had now no ruler, was committed
to the care of Sir Athelbrus, and Horn and
Rymenhild at last reached Suddene, where the people
received their fair queen with great joy, and where they
dwelt in happiness till their lives&rsquo; end.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV: ROBIN HOOD</h2>


<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">E</span>NGLAND during the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth
centuries was slowly taught the value
of firm administrative government. In Saxon
England, the keeping of the peace and the maintenance
of justice had been left largely to private and family enterprise
and to local and trading communities. In Norman
England, the royal authority was asserted throughout the
kingdom, though as yet the king had to depend in large
measure upon the co-operation of his barons and the help
of the burghers to supply the lack of a standing army and
an adequate police. Under the Plantagenets, the older
chivalry was slowly breaking up, and a new, wealthy
burgher and trading community was rapidly gaining
influence in the land; whilst the clergy, corrupted by
excess of wealth and power, had strained, almost to
breaking, the controlling force of religion. It was
therefore natural that in these latter days a class of
men should arise to avail themselves of the unique
opportunities of the time&mdash;men who, loving liberty and
hating oppression, took the law into their own hands and
executed a rough and ready justice between the rich and
the poor which embodied the best traditions of knight-errantry,
whilst they themselves lived a free and merry
life on the tolls they exacted from their wealthy victims.
Such a man may well have been the original Robin
Hood, a man who, when once he had captured the
popular imagination, soon acquired heroic reputation
and was credited with every daring deed and every magnanimous
action in two centuries of &lsquo;freebooting.&rsquo;</p>


<h3>Robin Hood Seeks a Guest</h3>

<p>At one time Robin Hood lived in the noble forest of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg&nbsp;315]</a></span>
Barnesdale, in Yorkshire. He had but few of his merry
men with him, for his headquarters were in the glorious
forest of Sherwood. Just now, however, the Sheriff of
Nottinghamshire was less active in his endeavours to put
down the band of outlaws, and the leader had wandered
farther north than usual. Robin&rsquo;s companions were his
three dearest comrades and most loyal followers, Little
John (so called because of his great stature), Will Scarlet,
Robin&rsquo;s cousin, and Much, the miller&rsquo;s son. These three
were all devoted to their leader, and never left his side,
except at such times as he sent them away on his business.</p>

<p>On this day Robin was leaning against a tree, lost in
thought, and his three followers grew impatient; they
knew that before dinner could be served there were the
three customary Masses to hear, and their leader gave
no sign of being ready for Mass. Robin always heard
three Masses before his dinner, one of the Father, one
of the Holy Spirit, and the last of Our Lady, who was
his patron saint and protector. As the three yeomen
were growing hungry, Little John ventured to address
him. &ldquo;Master, it would do you good if you would
dine early to-day, for you have fasted long.&rdquo; Robin
aroused himself and smiled. &ldquo;Ah, Little John, methinks
care for thine own appetite hath a share in that
speech, as well as care for me. But in sooth I care not
to dine alone. I would have a stranger guest, some
abbot or bishop or baron, who would pay us for our
hospitality. I will not dine till a guest be found, and
I leave it to you three to find him.&rdquo; Robin turned
away, laughing at the crestfallen faces of his followers,
who had not counted on such a vague commission;
but Little John, quickly recovering himself, called to
him: &ldquo;Master, tell us, before we leave you, where we
shall meet, and what sort of people we are to capture
and bring to you in the greenwood.&rdquo;</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg&nbsp;316]</a></span></p>

<h3>The Outlaws&rsquo; Rules</h3>

<p>&ldquo;You know that already,&rdquo; said their master. &ldquo;You
are to do no harm to women, nor to any company in
which a woman is travelling; this is in honour of our
dear Lady. You are to be kind and gentle to husbandmen
and toilers of all degrees, to worthy knights and yeomen,
to gallant squires, and to all children and helpless
people; but sheriffs (especially him of Nottingham),
bishops, and prelates of all kinds, and usurers in Church
and State, you may regard as your enemies, and may
rob, beat, and despoil in any way. Meet me with your
guest at our great trysting oak in the forest, and be
speedy, for dinner must wait until the visitor has
arrived.&rdquo; &ldquo;Now may God send us a suitable traveller
soon,&rdquo; said Little John, &ldquo;for I am hungry for dinner
now.&rdquo; &ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; said each of the others, and
Robin laughed again. &ldquo;Go ye all three, with bows
and arrows in hand, and I will stay alone at the trysting
tree and await your coming. As no man passes this
way, you can walk up to the willow plantation and
take your stand on Watling Street; there you will
soon meet with likely travellers, and I will accept the
first who appears. I will find means to have dinner
ready against your return, and we will hope that our
visitor&rsquo;s generosity will compensate us for the trouble
of cooking his dinner.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>Robin Hood&rsquo;s Guest</h3>

<p>The three yeomen, taking their longbows in hand
and arrows in their belts, walked up through the willow
plantation to a place on Watling Street where another
road crossed it; but there was no one in sight. As
they stood with bows in hand, looking towards the
forest of Barnesdale, they saw in the distance a knight
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg&nbsp;317]</a></span>
riding in their direction. As he drew nearer they
were struck by his appearance, for he rode as a man
who had lost all interest in life; his clothes were
disordered, he looked neither to right nor left, but
drooped his head sadly, while one foot hung in the
stirrup and the other dangled slackly in the air. The
yeomen had never seen so doleful a rider; but, sad as
he was, this was a visitor and must be taken to Robin;
accordingly Little John stepped forward and caught the
horse by the bridle.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;Little John caught the horse by the bridle&rdquo;</p>


<h3>Little John Escorts the Knight</h3>

<p>The knight raised his head and looked blankly at the
outlaw, who at once doffed his cap, saying, &ldquo;Welcome,
Sir Knight! I give you, on my master&rsquo;s behalf, a hearty
welcome to the greenwood. Gentle knight, come now
to my master, who hath waited three hours, fasting,
for your approach before he would dine. Dinner is
prepared, and only tarries your courteous appearance.&rdquo;
The stranger knight seemed to consider this address
carefully, for he sighed deeply, and then said: &ldquo;I cry
thee mercy, good fellow, for the delay, though I wot
not how I am the cause thereof. But who is thy
master?&rdquo; Little John replied: &ldquo;My master&rsquo;s name is
Robin Hood, and I am sent to guide you to him.&rdquo; The
knight said: &ldquo;So Robin Hood is thy leader? I have
heard of him, and know him to be a good yeoman;
therefore I am ready to accompany thee, though, in
good sooth, I had intended to eat my midday meal at
Blythe or Doncaster to-day. But it matters little where
a broken man dines!&rdquo;</p>


<h3>Robin Hood&rsquo;s Feast</h3>

<p>The three yeomen conducted the knight along the
forest ways to the trysting oak where Robin awaited
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg&nbsp;318]</a></span>
them. As they went they observed that the knight
was weeping silently for some great distress, but their
courtesy forbade them to make any show of noticing
his grief. When the appointed spot was reached, Robin
stepped forward and courteously greeted his guest,
with head uncovered and bended knee, and welcomed
him gladly to the wild greenwood. &ldquo;Welcome, Sir
Knight, to our greenwood feast! I have waited three
hours for a guest, and now Our Lady has sent you to
me we can dine, after we have heard Mass.&rdquo; The
knight said nothing but, &ldquo;God save you, good Robin,
and all your merry men&rdquo;; and then very devoutly they
heard the three Masses, sung by Friar Tuck. By this
time others of the outlaw band had appeared, having
returned from various errands, and a gay company sat
down to a banquet as good as any the knight had ever
eaten.</p>


<h3>Robin Converses with the Knight</h3>

<p>There was abundance of good things&mdash;venison and
game of all kinds, swans and river-fowl and fish, with
bread and good wine. Every one seemed joyous, and
merry jests went round that jovial company, till even
the careworn guest began to smile, and then to laugh
outright. At this Robin was well pleased, for he saw that
his visitor was a good man, and was glad to have lifted
the burden of his care, even if only for a few minutes;
so he smiled cheerfully at the knight and said: &ldquo;Be
merry, Sir Knight, I pray, and eat heartily of our food,
for it is with great goodwill that we offer it to you.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Thanks, good Robin,&rdquo; replied the knight. &ldquo;I have
enjoyed my dinner to-day greatly; for three weeks I
have not had so good a meal. If I ever pass by this
way again I will do my best to repay you in kind; as good
a dinner will I try to provide as you have given me.&rdquo;</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg&nbsp;319]</a></span></p>

<h3>Robin Demands Payment</h3>

<p>The outlaw chief seemed to be affronted by this
suggestion, and replied, with a touch of pride in his
manner: &ldquo;Thanks for your proffer, Sir Knight, but,
by Heaven! no man has ever yet deemed me a glutton.
While I eat one dinner I am not accustomed to look
eagerly for another&mdash;one is enough for me. But as
for you, my guest, I think it only fitting that you
should pay before you go; a yeoman was never meant
to pay for a knight&rsquo;s banquet.&rdquo; The knight blushed,
and looked confused for a moment, and then said:
&ldquo;True, Robin, and gladly would I reward you for my
entertainment, but I have no money worth offering;
even all I have would not be worthy of your acceptance,
and I should be shamed in your eyes, and those of your
men.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 421px;">
<img src="images/hmlbr46.jpg" width="421" height="600" alt="" />
<a name="image_page_320" id="image_page_320"></a>
</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;I have no money worth offering&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The Knight&rsquo;s Poverty</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Is that the truth?&rdquo; asked Robin, making a sign to
Little John, who arose, and, going to the knight&rsquo;s steed,
unstrapped a small coffer, which he brought back and
placed before his master. &ldquo;Search it, Little John,&rdquo;
said he, and &ldquo;You, sir, tell me the very truth, by your
honour as a belted knight.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is truth, on my
honour, that I have but ten shillings,&rdquo; replied the
knight, &ldquo;and if Little John searches he will find no
more.&rdquo; &ldquo;Open the coffer,&rdquo; said Robin, and Little John
took it away to the other side of the trysting oak,
where he emptied its contents on his outspread cloak,
and found exactly ten shillings. Returning to his
master, who sat at his ease, drinking and gaily conversing
with his anxious guest, Little John whispered:
&ldquo;The knight has told the truth,&rdquo; and thereupon Robin
exclaimed aloud: &ldquo;Sir Knight, I will not take one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg&nbsp;320]</a></span>
penny from you; you may rather borrow of me if you
have need of more money, for ten shillings is but a
miserable sum for a knight. But tell me now, if it be
your pleasure, how you come to be in such distress.&rdquo;
As he looked inquiringly at the stranger, whose blush
had faded once, only to be renewed as he found his
word of honour doubted, he noticed how thin and
threadbare were his clothes and how worn his russet
leather shoes; and he was grieved to see so noble-seeming
a man in such a plight.</p>


<h3>The Knight&rsquo;s Story</h3>

<p>Yet Robin meant to fathom the cause of the knight&rsquo;s
trouble, for then, perhaps, he would be able to help him,
so he continued pitilessly: &ldquo;Tell me just one word,
which I will keep secret from all other men: were you
driven by compulsion to take up knighthood, or urged
to beg it by reason of the ownership of some small
estate; or have you wasted your old inheritance with
fines for brawling and strife, or in gambling and riotousness,
or in borrowing at usury? All of these are fatal
to a good estate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The knight replied: &ldquo;Alas! good Robin, none of
these hath been my undoing. My ancestors have all
been knights for over a hundred years, and I have not
lived wastefully, but soberly and sparely. As short a
time ago as last year I had over four hundred pounds
saved, which I could spend freely among my neighbours,
and my income was four hundred pounds a year, from
my land; but now my only possessions are my wife and
children. This is the work of God&rsquo;s hand, and to Him I
commit me to amend my estate in His own good time.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>How the Money was Lost</h3>

<p>&ldquo;But how have you so soon lost this great wealth?&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg&nbsp;321]</a></span>
asked Robin incredulously; and the knight replied
sadly: &ldquo;Ah, Robin, you have no son, or you would
know that a father will give up all to save his first-born.
I have one gallant son, and when I went on the Crusade
with our noble Prince Edward I left him at home to
guard my lands, for he was twenty years old, and was a
brave and comely youth. When I returned, after two
years&rsquo; absence, it was to find him in great danger, for in
a public tournament he had slain in open fight a knight
of Lancashire and a bold young squire. He would
have died a shameful death had I not spent all my
ready money and other property to save him from
prison, for his enemies were mighty and unjust; and
even that was not enough, for I was forced to mortgage
my estates for more money. All my land lies in pledge
to the abbot of St. Mary&rsquo;s Abbey, in York, and I have
no hope to redeem it. I was riding to York when
your men found me.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The Sum Required</h3>

<p>&ldquo;For what sum is your land pledged?&rdquo; asked the
master-outlaw; and the knight replied: &ldquo;The Abbot lent
me four hundred pounds, though the value of the land
is far beyond that.&rdquo; &ldquo;What will you do if you fail
to redeem your land?&rdquo; asked Robin. &ldquo;I shall leave
England at once, and journey once more to Jerusalem,
and tread again the sacred Hill of Calvary, and never
more return to my native land. That will be my fate,
for I see no likelihood of repaying the loan, and I will
not stay to see strangers holding my father&rsquo;s land. Farewell,
my friend Robin, farewell to you all! Keep the
ten shillings; I would have paid more if I could, but
that is the best I can give you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Have you no
friends at home?&rdquo; asked Robin; and the knight said:
&ldquo;Many friends I thought I had, sir. They were very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg&nbsp;322]</a></span>
kind and helpful in my days of prosperity, when I did not
need them; now they will not know me, so much has
my poverty seemed to alter my face and appearance.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>Robin Offers a Loan</h3>

<p>This pitiful story touched the hearts of the simple and
kindly outlaws; they wept for pity, and cared not to hide
their tears from each other, until Robin made them all
pledge their guest in bumpers of good red wine. Then
their chief asked, as if continuing his own train of thought:
&ldquo;Have you any friends who will act as sureties for the
repayment of the loan?&rdquo; &ldquo;None at all,&rdquo; replied the
knight hopelessly, &ldquo;but God Himself, who suffered
on the Tree for us.&rdquo; This last reply angered Robin,
who thought it savoured too much of companionship
with the fat and hypocritical monks whom he hated,
and he retorted sharply: &ldquo;No such tricks for me! Do
you think I will take such a surety, or even one of the
saints, in return for good solid gold? Get some more
substantial surety, or no gold shall you have from me.
I cannot afford to waste my money.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The Knight Offers Surety</h3>

<p>The knight replied, sighing heavily: &ldquo;If you will
not take these I have no earthly surety to offer; and in
Heaven there is only our dear Lady. I have served
her truly, and she has never failed me till now, when
her servant, the abbot, is playing me so cruel a trick.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Do you give Our Lady as your surety?&rdquo; said Robin
Hood. &ldquo;I would take her bond for any sum, for
throughout all England you could find no better surety
than our dear Lady, who has always been gracious to
me. She is enough security. Go, Little John, to my
treasury and bring me four hundred pounds, well
counted, with no false or clipped coin therein.&rdquo;</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg&nbsp;323]</a></span></p>

<h3>Robin Hood&rsquo;s Gifts</h3>

<p>Little John, accompanied by Much, the careful
treasurer of the band, went quickly to the secret place
where the master-outlaw kept his gold. Very carefully
they counted out the coins, testing each, to see that it
was of full weight and value. Then, on the suggestion
of Little John, they provided the knight with new
clothing, even to boots and spurs, and finally supplied
him with two splendid horses, one for riding and one
to carry his baggage and the coffer of gold.</p>

<p>The guest watched all these preparations with bewildered
eyes, and turned to Robin, crying, &ldquo;Why
have you done all this for me, a perfect stranger?&rdquo;
&ldquo;You are no stranger, but Our Lady&rsquo;s messenger. She
sent you to me, and Heaven grant you may prove true.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The Bond of Repayment</h3>

<p>&ldquo;God grant it,&rdquo; echoed the knight. &ldquo;But, Robin,
when shall I repay this loan, and where? Set me a
day, and I will keep it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; replied the outlaw,
&ldquo;under this greenwood tree, and in a twelvemonth&rsquo;s
time; so will you have time to regain your friends and
gather your rents from your redeemed lands. Now
farewell, Sir Knight; and since it is not meet for a
worthy knight to journey unattended, I will lend you
also my comrade, Little John, to be your squire, and
to do you yeoman service, if need be.&rdquo; The knight
bade farewell to Robin and his generous followers, and
was turning to ride away, when he suddenly stopped
and addressed the master-outlaw: &ldquo;In faith, good
Robin, I had forgotten one thing. You know not my
name. I am Sir Richard of the Lea, and my land lies
in Uterysdale.&rdquo; &ldquo;As for that,&rdquo; said Robin Hood, &ldquo;I
trouble not myself. You are Our Lady&rsquo;s messenger;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg&nbsp;324]</a></span>
that is enough for me.&rdquo; So Sir Richard rode gladly
away, blessing the generous outlaw who lent him money
to redeem his land, and a stout yeoman to defend the
loan.</p>


<h3>Sir Richard&rsquo;s Journey</h3>

<p>As the knight and his new servant rode on, Sir
Richard called to his man, saying, &ldquo;I must by all
means be in York to-morrow, to pay the abbot of
St. Mary&rsquo;s four hundred pounds; if I fail of my day
I shall lose my land and lordship for ever&rdquo;; and Little
John answered: &ldquo;Fear not, master; we will surely be
there in time enough.&rdquo; Then they rode on, and reached
York early on the last day of the appointed time.</p>


<h3>The Abbot and Prior of St. Mary&rsquo;s</h3>

<p>In the meantime the abbot of St. Mary&rsquo;s was
counting that Sir Richard&rsquo;s lands were safely his; he
had no pity for the poor unlucky knight, but rather
exulted in the legal cruelty which he could inflict.
Very joyfully he called aloud, early that morn: &ldquo;A
twelvemonth ago to-day we lent four hundred pounds
to a needy knight, Sir Richard of the Lea, and unless
he comes by noon to-day to repay the money he will
lose all his land and be disinherited, and our abbey will
be the richer by a fat estate, worth four hundred pounds
a year. Our Lady grant that he keep not his day.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Shame on you!&rdquo; cried the prior. &ldquo;This poor knight
may be ill, or beyond the sea; he may be in hunger
and cold as well as poverty, and it will be a foul
wrong if you declare his land forfeit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the set day,&rdquo; replied the abbot, &ldquo;and he is
not here.&rdquo; &ldquo;You dare not escheat his estates yet,&rdquo;
replied the prior stubbornly. &ldquo;It is too early in the
day; until noon the lands are still Sir Richard&rsquo;s, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg&nbsp;325]</a></span>
no man shall take them ere the clock strikes. Shame
on your conscience and your greed, to do a good knight
such foul wrong! I would willingly pay a hundred
pounds myself to prevent it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beshrew your meddlesome temper!&rdquo; cried the
abbot. &ldquo;You are always crossing me! But I have
with me the Lord Chief Justice, and he will declare my
legal right.&rdquo; Just at that moment the high cellarer
of the abbey entered to congratulate the abbot on Sir
Richard&rsquo;s absence. &ldquo;He is dead or ill, and we shall
have the spending of four hundred pounds a year,&rdquo;
quoth he.</p>


<h3>Sir Richard Returns</h3>

<p>On his arrival Sir Richard had quietly gone round to
his old tenants in York, and had a goodly company of
them ready to ride with him, but he was minded to test
the charity and true religion of the abbot, and bade his
followers assume pilgrims&rsquo; robes. Thus attired, the
company rode to the abbey gate, where the porter recognised
Sir Richard, and the news of his coming, carried
to the abbot and justice, caused them great grief; but
the prior rejoiced, hoping that a cruel injustice would
be prevented. As they dismounted the porter loudly
called grooms to lead the horses into the stable and
have them relieved of their burdens, but Sir Richard
would not allow it, and left Little John to watch over
them at the abbey portal.</p>


<h3>The Abbot and Sir Richard</h3>

<p>Then Sir Richard came humbly into the hall, where
a great banquet was in progress, and knelt down in
courteous salutation to the abbot and his guests; but
the prelate, who had made up his mind what conduct
to adopt, greeted him coldly, and many men did not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg&nbsp;326]</a></span>
return his salutation at all. Sir Richard spoke aloud:
&ldquo;Rejoice, Sir Abbot, for I am come to keep my day.&rdquo;
&ldquo;That is well,&rdquo; replied the monk, &ldquo;but hast thou
brought the money?&rdquo; &ldquo;No money have I, not one
penny,&rdquo; continued Sir Richard sadly. &ldquo;Pledge me in
good red wine, Sir Justice,&rdquo; cried the abbot callously;
&ldquo;the land is mine. And what dost thou here, Sir
Richard, a broken man, with no money to pay thy
debt?&rdquo; &ldquo;I am come to beg you to grant me a longer
time for repayment.&rdquo; &ldquo;Not one minute past the appointed
hour,&rdquo; said the exultant prelate. &ldquo;Thou hast
broken pledge, and thy land is forfeit.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 416px;">
<img src="images/hmlbr47.jpg" width="416" height="600" alt="" />
<a name="image_page_324" id="image_page_324"></a>
</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;Sir Richard knelt in courteous salutation&rdquo;</p>


<h3>Sir Richard Implores the Justice</h3>

<p>Still kneeling, Sir Richard turned to the justice and
said: &ldquo;Good Sir Justice, be my friend and plead for
me.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I hold to the law, and can
give thee no help.&rdquo; &ldquo;Gentle abbot, have pity on me,
and let me have my land again, and I will be the humble
servant of your monastery till I have repaid in full your
four hundred pounds.&rdquo; Then the cruel prelate swore
a terrible oath that never should the knight have his
land again, and no one in the hall would speak for
him, kneeling there poor, friendless, and alone; so at
last he began to threaten violence. &ldquo;Unless I have
my land again,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;some of you here shall
dearly abide it. Now may I see the poor man has no
friends, for none will stand by me in my need.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The Justice Suggests a Compromise</h3>

<p>The hint of violence made the abbot furiously
angry, and, secure in his position and the support of
the justice, he shouted loudly: &ldquo;Out, thou false knight!
Out of my hall!&rdquo; Then at last Sir Richard rose to his
feet in just wrath. &ldquo;Thou liest, Sir Abbot; foully thou
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg&nbsp;327]</a></span>
liest! I was never a false knight. In joust and
tourney I have adventured as far and as boldly as any
man alive. There is no true courtesy in thee, abbot,
to suffer a knight to kneel so long.&rdquo; The quarrel now
seemed so serious that the justice intervened, saying to
the angry prelate, &ldquo;What will you give me if I persuade
him to sign a legal deed of release? Without it you
will never hold this land in peace.&rdquo; &ldquo;You shall have a
hundred pounds for yourself,&rdquo; said the abbot, and the
justice nodded in token of assent.</p>


<h3>Sir Richard Pays the Money</h3>

<p>Now Sir Richard thought it was time to drop the
mask, for noon was nigh, and he would not risk his
land again. Accordingly he cried: &ldquo;Nay, but not so
easily shall ye have my lands. Even if you were to pay
a thousand pounds more you should not hold my
father&rsquo;s estate. Have here your money back again&rdquo;;
and, calling for Little John, he bade him bring into the
hall his coffer with the bags inside. Then he counted
out on the table four hundred good golden pounds,
and said sternly: &ldquo;Abbot, here is your money again.
Had you but been courteous to me I would have rewarded
you well; now take your money, give me
a quittance, and I will take my lands once more. Ye
are all witnesses that I have kept my day and have paid
in full.&rdquo; Thereupon Sir Richard strode haughtily out
of the hall, and rode home gladly to his recovered
lands in Uterysdale, where he and his family ever
prayed for Robin Hood. The abbot of St. Mary&rsquo;s
was bitterly enraged, for he had lost the fair lands
of Sir Richard of the Lea and had received a bare
four hundred pounds again. As for Little John,
he went back to the forest and told his master the
whole story, to Robin Hood&rsquo;s great satisfaction,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg&nbsp;328]</a></span>
for he enjoyed the chance of thwarting the schemes of
a wealthy and usurious prelate.</p>


<h3>Sir Richard Sets Out to Repay the Loan</h3>

<p>When a year had passed all but a few days, Sir
Richard of the Lea said to his wife: &ldquo;Lady, I must
shortly go to Barnesdale to repay Robin Hood the loan
which saved my lands, and would fain take him some small
gift in addition; what do you advise?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir Richard,
I would take a hundred bows of Spanish yew and a
hundred sheaves of arrows, peacock-feathered, or grey-goose-feathered;
methinks that will be to Robin a
most acceptable gift.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Richard followed his wife&rsquo;s advice, and on the
morning of the appointed day set out to keep his tryst
at the outlaws&rsquo; oak in Barnesdale, with the money duly
counted, and the bows and arrows for his present to
the outlaw chief.</p>


<h3>The Wrestling</h3>

<p>As he rode, however, at the head of his troop he
passed through a village where there was a wrestling
contest, which he stayed to watch. He soon saw that
the victorious wrestler, who was a stranger to the
village, would be defrauded of his well-earned prize,
which consisted of a white bull, a noble charger gaily
caparisoned, a gold ring, a pipe of wine, and a pair of
embroidered gloves. This seemed so wrong to Sir
Richard that he stayed to defend the right, for love of
Robin Hood and of justice, and kept the wrestling ring
in awe with his well-appointed troop of men, so that
the stranger was allowed to claim his prize and carry it
off. Sir Richard, anxious not to arouse the hostility of
the villagers, bought the pipe of wine from the winner,
and, setting it abroach, allowed all who would to drink;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg&nbsp;329]</a></span>
and so, in a tumult of cheers and blessings, he rode
away to keep his tryst. By this time, however, it was
nearly three in the afternoon, and he should have been
there at twelve. He comforted himself with the thought
that Robin would forgive the delay, for the sake of its
cause, and so rode on comfortably enough at the head
of his gallant company.</p>


<h3>Robin&rsquo;s Impatience</h3>

<p>In the meantime Robin had waited patiently at the
trysting tree till noon, but when the hour passed
and Sir Richard had not appeared he began to grow
impatient. &ldquo;Master, let us dine,&rdquo; said Little John.
&ldquo;I cannot; I fear Our Lady is angered with me,
for she has not sent me my money,&rdquo; returned the
leader; but his follower replied: &ldquo;The money is not
due till sunset, master, and Our Lady is true, and so is
Sir Richard; have no fear.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you three walk up
through the willow plantation to Watling Street, as
you did last year, and bring me a guest,&rdquo; said Robin
Hood. &ldquo;He may be a messenger, a minstrel, a poor
man, but he will come in God&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The Monks Approach</h3>

<p>Again the three yeomen, Little John, Will Scarlet,
and Much the miller&rsquo;s son, took bow in hand and set
out for Watling Street; but this time they had not long
to wait, for they at once saw a little procession approaching.
Two black monks rode at the head; then followed
seven sumpter-mules and a train of fifty-two men, so
that the clerics rode in almost royal state. &ldquo;Seest
thou yon monks?&rdquo; said Little John. &ldquo;I will pledge
my soul that they have brought our pay.&rdquo; &ldquo;But they
are fifty-four, and we are but three,&rdquo; said Scarlet.
&ldquo;Unless we bring them to dinner we dare not face
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg&nbsp;330]</a></span>
our master,&rdquo; cried Little John. &ldquo;Look well to your
bows, your strings and arrows, and have stout hearts
and steady hands. I will take the foremost monk, for
life or death.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The Capture of the Black Monk</h3>

<p>The three outlaws stepped out into the road from
the shelter of the wood; they bent their bows and
held their arrows on the string, and Little John cried
aloud: &ldquo;Stay, churlish monk, or thou goest to thy
death, and it will be on thine own head! Evil on
thee for keeping our master fasting so long.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who
is your master?&rdquo; asked the bewildered monk; and
Little John replied: &ldquo;Robin Hood.&rdquo; The monk tossed
his head. &ldquo;He is a foul thief,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;and will
come to a bad end. I have heard no good of him all
my days.&rdquo; So speaking, he tried to ride forward and
trample down the three yeomen; but Little John cried:
&ldquo;Thou liest, churlish monk, and thou shalt rue the lie.
He is a good yeoman of this forest, and has bidden
thee to dine with him this day&rdquo;; and Much, drawing
his bow, shot the monk to the heart, so that he fell to
the ground dead. The other black monk was taken,
but all his followers fled, except a little page, and a
groom who tended the sumpter-mules; and thus, with
Little John&rsquo;s help and guidance, the panic-stricken
cleric and his train of baggage were brought to Robin
under the trysting tree.</p>

<a name="image_page_330" id="image_page_330"></a>
</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;Much shot the monk to the heart&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The Outlaws&rsquo; Feast</h3>

<p>Robin Hood doffed his cap and greeted his guest
with all courtesy, but the monk would not reply, and
Little John&rsquo;s account of their meeting made it evident
that he was a churlish and unwilling guest. However,
he was obliged to celebrate the three usual Masses, was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg&nbsp;331]</a></span>
given water for his ablutions before the banquet, and
then when the whole fellowship was assembled he was
set in the place of honour at the feast, and reverently
served by Robin himself. &ldquo;Be of good cheer, Sir
Monk,&rdquo; said Robin. &ldquo;Where is your abbey when you
are at home, and who is your patron saint?&rdquo; &ldquo;I am
of St. Mary&rsquo;s Abbey, in York, and, simple though I be,
I am the high cellarer.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The High Cellarer and the Suretyship</h3>

<p>&ldquo;For Our Lady&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; said Robin, &ldquo;we will give
this monk the best of cheer. Drink to me, Sir Monk;
the wine is good. But I fear Our Lady is wroth with
me, for she has not sent me my money.&rdquo; &ldquo;Fear not,
master,&rdquo; returned Little John; &ldquo;this monk is her
cellarer, and no doubt she has made him her messenger
and he carries our money with him.&rdquo; &ldquo;That is
likely,&rdquo; replied Robin. &ldquo;Sir Monk, Our Lady was
surety for a little loan between a good knight and me,
and to-day the money was to be repaid. If you have
brought it, pay it to me now, and I will thank you
heartily.&rdquo; The monk was quite amazed, and cried
aloud: &ldquo;I have never heard of such a suretyship&rdquo;;
and as he spoke he looked so anxiously at his
sumpter-mules that Robin guessed there was gold in
their pack-saddles.</p>


<h3>The Monk is Searched</h3>

<p>Accordingly the leader feigned sudden anger. &ldquo;Sir
Monk, how dare you defame our dear Lady? She
is always true and faithful, and as you say you are
her servant, no doubt she has made you her messenger
to bring my money. Tell me truly how much
you have in your coffers, and I will thank you for
coming so punctually.&rdquo; The monk replied: &ldquo;Sir, I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg&nbsp;332]</a></span>
have only twenty marks in my bags&rdquo;; to which Robin
answered: &ldquo;If that be all, and you have told the truth
I will not touch one penny; rather will I lend you some
if you need it; but if I find more, I will leave none,
Sir Monk, for a religious man should have no silver to
spend in luxury.&rdquo; Now the monk looked very greatly
alarmed, but he dared make no protest, as Little John
began to search his bags and coffers.</p>


<h3>Success of the Search</h3>

<p>When Little John opened the first coffer he emptied
its contents, as before, into his cloak, and counted eight
hundred pounds, with which he went to Robin Hood,
saying, &ldquo;Master, the monk has told the truth; here
are twenty marks of his own, and eight hundred pounds
which Our Lady has sent you in return for your loan.&rdquo;
When Robin heard that he cried to the miserable
monk: &ldquo;Did I not say so, monk? Is not Our Lady
the best surety a man could have? Has she not repaid
me twice? Go back to your abbey and say that if ever
St. Mary&rsquo;s monks need a friend they shall find one in
Robin Hood.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The Monk Departs</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Where were you journeying?&rdquo; asked the outlaw
leader. &ldquo;To settle accounts with the bailiffs of our
manors,&rdquo; replied the cellarer; but he was in truth
journeying to London, to obtain powers from the king
against Sir Richard of the Lea. Robin thought for a
moment, and then said: &ldquo;Ah, then we must search
your other coffer,&rdquo; and in spite of the cellarer&rsquo;s indignant
protests he was deprived of all the money
that second coffer contained. Then he was allowed
to depart, vowing bitterly that a dinner in Blythe or
Doncaster would have cost him much less dear.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg&nbsp;333]</a></span></p>

<h3>Sir Richard Arrives</h3>

<p>Late that afternoon Sir Richard of the Lea and his
little company arrived at the trysting tree, and full
courteously the knight greeted his deliverer and
apologised for his delay. Robin asked of his welfare,
and the knight told of his protection of the poor
wrestler, for which Robin thanked him warmly. When
he would fain have repaid the loan the generous outlaw
refused to accept the money, though he took with
hearty thanks the bows and arrows. In answer to the
knight&rsquo;s inquiries, Robin said that he had been paid
the money twice over before he came; and he told,
to his debtor&rsquo;s great amusement, the story of the high
cellarer and his eight hundred pounds, and concluded:
&ldquo;Our Lady owed me no more than four hundred
pounds, and she now gives you, by me, the other four
hundred. Take them, with her blessing, and if ever
you need more come to Robin Hood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Sir Richard returned to Uterysdale, and long
continued to use his power to protect the bold outlaws,
and Robin Hood dwelt securely in the greenwood,
doing good to the poor and worthy, but acting as a
thorn in the sides of all oppressors and tyrants.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI: HEREWARD THE WAKE</h2>


<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N dealing with hero-legends and myths we are sometimes
confronted with the curious fact that a hero
whose name and date can be ascertained with exactitude
has yet in his story mythological elements which
seem to belong to all the ages. This anomaly arises
chiefly from the fact that the imagination of a people is a
myth-making thing, and that the more truly popular the
hero the more likely he is to become the centre of a
whole cycle of myths, which are in different ages
attached to the heroes of different periods. The folk-lore
of primitive races is a great storehouse whence a
people can choose tales and heroic deeds to glorify its
own national hero, careless that the same tales and deeds
have done duty for other peoples and other heroes.
Hence it happens that Hereward the Saxon, a patriot
hero as real and actual as Wellington or Nelson, whose
deeds were recorded in prose and verse within forty
years of his death, was even then surrounded by a cloud
of romance and mystery, which hid in vagueness his
family, his marriage, and even his death.</p>


<h3>The Saxon Patriot</h3>

<p>Hereward was, naturally, the darling hero of the
Saxons, and for the patriotism of his splendid defence
of Ely they forgave his final surrender to William the
Norman; then they attributed to him all the virtues
supposed to be inherent in the free-born, and all the
glorious valour on which the English prided themselves;
and, lastly, they surrounded his death with a
halo of desperate fighting, and made his last conflict as
wonderful as that of Roland at Roncesvalles. If Roland
is the ideal of Norman feudal chivalry, Hereward is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg&nbsp;335]</a></span>
equally the ideal of Anglo-Saxon sturdy manliness and
knighthood, and it seems fitting that the Saxon ideal in
the individual should go down before the representatives,
however unworthy, of a higher ideal.</p>


<h3>Leofric of Mercia</h3>

<p>When the weak but saintly King Edward the
Confessor nominally ruled all England the land was
divided into four great earldoms, of which Mercia and
Kent were held by two powerful rivals. Leofric of
Mercia and Godwin of Kent were jealous not only for
themselves, but for their families, of each other&rsquo;s power
and wealth, and the sons of Leofric and of Godwin were
ever at strife, though the two earls were now old and
prudent men, whose wars were fought with words and
craft, not with swords. The wives of the two great
earls were as different as their lords. The Lady Gytha,
Godwin&rsquo;s wife, of the royal Danish race, was fierce and
haughty, a fit helpmeet for the ambitious earl who
was to undermine the strength of England by his
efforts to win kingly power for his children. But the
Lady Godiva, Leofric&rsquo;s beloved wife, was a gentle,
pious, loving woman, who had already won an almost
saintly reputation for sympathy and pity by her sacrifice
to save her husband&rsquo;s oppressed citizens at Coventry,
where her pleading won relief for them from the harsh
earl on the pitiless condition of her never-forgotten
ride. Happily her gentle self-suppression awoke a
nobler spirit in her husband, and enabled him to
play a worthier part in England&rsquo;s history. She was
in entire sympathy with the religious aspirations of
Edward the Confessor, and would gladly have seen
one of her sons become a monk, perhaps to win
spiritual power and a saintly reputation like those of
the great Dunstan.</p>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;Her pleading won relief for them&rdquo;</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg&nbsp;336]</a></span></p>

<h3>Hereward&rsquo;s Youth</h3>

<p>For this holy vocation she fixed on her second son,
Hereward, a wild, wayward lad, with long golden curls,
eyes of different colours, one grey, one blue, great
breadth and strength of limb, and a wild and ungovernable
temper which made him difficult of control. This
reckless lad the Lady Godiva vainly tried to educate
for the monkish life, but he utterly refused to adopt
her scheme, would not master any but the barest
rudiments of learning, and spent his time in wrestling,
boxing, fighting and all manly exercises. Despairing
of making him an ecclesiastic, his mother set herself to
inspire him with a noble ideal of knighthood, but his
wildness and recklessness increased with his years, and
often his mother had to stand between the riotous lad
and his father&rsquo;s deserved anger.</p>


<h3>His Strength and Leadership</h3>

<p>When he reached the age of sixteen or seventeen he
became the terror of the Fen Country, for at his father&rsquo;s
Hall of Bourne he gathered a band of youths as wild
and reckless as himself, who accepted him for their
leader, and obeyed him implicitly, however outrageous
were his commands. The wise Earl Leofric, who was
much at court with the saintly king, understood little
of the nature of his second son, and looked upon his
wild deeds as evidence of a cruel and lawless mind, a
menace to the peace of England, while they were in
reality but the tokens of a restless energy for which
the comparatively peaceable life of England at that
time was all too dull and tame.</p>


<h3>Leofric and Hereward</h3>

<p>Frequent were the disputes between father and son,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg&nbsp;337]</a></span>
and sadly did Lady Godiva forebode an evil ending to
the clash of warring natures whenever Hereward and
his father met; yet she could do nothing to avert
disaster, for though her entreaties would soften the lad
into penitence for some mad prank or reckless outrage,
one hint of cold blame from his father would suffice to
make him hardened and impenitent; and so things
drifted from bad to worse. In all Hereward&rsquo;s lawless
deeds, however, there was no meanness or crafty malice.
He hated monks and played many a rough trick upon
them, but took his punishment, when it came, with
equable cheerfulness; he robbed merchants with a high
hand, but made reparation liberally, counting himself
well satisfied with the fun of a fight or the skill of a
clever trick; his band of youths met and fought other
bands, but they bore no malice when the strife was
over. In one point only was Hereward less than true
to his own nobility of character&mdash;he was jealous of
admitting that any man was his superior in strength
or comeliness, and his vanity was well supported by his
extraordinary might and beauty.</p>


<h3>Hereward at Court</h3>

<p>The deeds which brought Earl Leofric&rsquo;s wrath upon
his son in a terrible fashion were not matters of wanton
wickedness, but of lawless personal violence. Called to
attend his father to the Confessor&rsquo;s court, the youth,
who had little respect for one so unwarlike as &ldquo;the
miracle-monger,&rdquo; uttered his contempt for saintly king,
Norman prelate, and studious monks too loudly, and
thereby shocked the weakly devout Edward, who
thought piety the whole duty of man. But his wildness
touched the king more nearly still; for in his sturdy
patriotism he hated the Norman favourites and courtiers
who surrounded the Confessor, and again and again his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg&nbsp;338]</a></span>
marvellous strength was shown in the personal injuries
he inflicted on the Normans in mere boyish brawls,
until at last his father could endure the disgrace no
longer.</p>


<h3>Hereward&rsquo;s Exile</h3>

<p>Begging an audience of the king, Leofric formally
asked for a writ of outlawry against his own son. The
Confessor, surprised, but not displeased, felt some compunction
as he saw the father&rsquo;s affection overborne by
the judge&rsquo;s severity. Earl Godwin, Leofric&rsquo;s greatest
rival, was present in the council, and his pleading for
the noble lad, whose faults were only those of youth, was
sufficient to make Leofric more urgent in his petition.
The curse of family feud, which afterwards laid England
prostrate at the foot of the Conqueror, was already felt,
and felt so strongly that Hereward resented Godwin&rsquo;s
intercession more than his father&rsquo;s sternness.</p>


<h3>Hereward&rsquo;s Farewell</h3>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;shall a son of Leofric, the noblest
man in England, accept intercession from Godwin or
any of his family? No. I may be unworthy of my
wise father and my saintly mother, but I am not yet sunk
so low as to ask a favour from a Godwin. Father, I
thank you. For years I have fretted against the peace
of the land, and thus have incurred your displeasure;
but in exile I may range abroad and win my fortune at
the sword&rsquo;s point.&rdquo; &ldquo;Win thy fortune, foolish boy!&rdquo;
said his father. &ldquo;And whither wilt thou fare?&rdquo; &ldquo;Wherever
fate and my fortune lead me,&rdquo; he replied recklessly.
&ldquo;Perhaps to join Harald Hardrada at Constantinople
and become one of the Emperor&rsquo;s Varangian Guard;
perhaps to follow old Beowa out into the West, at the
end of some day of glorious battle; perhaps to fight
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg&nbsp;339]</a></span>
giants and dragons and all kinds of monsters. All
these things I may do, but never shall Mercia see me
again till England calls me home. Farewell, father;
farewell, Earl Godwin; farewell, reverend king. I go.
And pray ye that ye may never need my arm, for it
may hap that ye will call me and I will not come.&rdquo;
Then Hereward rode away, followed into exile by one
man only, Martin Lightfoot, who left the father&rsquo;s
service for that of his outlawed son. It was when
attending the king&rsquo;s court on this occasion that Hereward
first saw and felt the charm of a lovely little
Saxon maiden named Alftruda, a ward of the pious
king.</p>


<h3>Hereward in Northumbria</h3>

<p>Though the king&rsquo;s writ of outlawry might run in
Mercia, it did not carry more than nominal weight in
Northumbria, where Earl Siward ruled almost as an
independent lord. Thither Hereward determined to
go, for there dwelt his own godfather, Gilbert of Ghent,
and his castle was known as a good training school for
young aspirants for knighthood. Sailing from Dover,
Hereward landed at Whitby, and made his way to
Gilbert&rsquo;s castle, where he was well received, since the
cunning Fleming knew that an outlawry could be
reversed at any time, and Leofric&rsquo;s son might yet come
to rule England. Accordingly Hereward was enrolled
in the number of young men, mainly Normans or
Flemings, who were seeking to perfect themselves in
chivalry before taking knighthood. He soon showed
himself a brave warrior, an unequalled wrestler, and a
wary fighter, and soon no one cared to meddle with the
young Mercian, who outdid them all in manly sports.
The envy of the young Normans was held in check by
Gilbert, and by a wholesome dread of Hereward&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg&nbsp;340]</a></span>
strong arm; until, in Gilbert&rsquo;s absence, an incident
occurred which placed the young exile on a pinnacle so
far above them that only by his death could they hope
to rid themselves of their feeling of inferiority.</p>


<h3>The Fairy Bear</h3>

<p>Gilbert kept in his castle court an immense white
Polar bear, dreaded by all for its enormous strength,
and called the Fairy Bear. It was even believed that
the huge beast had some kinship to old Earl Siward,
who bore a bear upon his crest, and was reputed to
have had something of bear-like ferocity in his youth.
This white bear was so much dreaded that he was kept
chained up in a strong cage. One morning as Hereward
was returning with Martin from his morning ride he
heard shouts and shrieks from the castle yard, and,
reaching the great gate, entered lightly and closed it
behind him rapidly, for there outside the shattered cage,
with broken chain dangling, stood the Fairy Bear,
glaring savagely round the courtyard. But one human
figure was in sight, that of a girl of about twelve years
of age.</p>


<h3>Hereward Slays the Bear</h3>

<p>There were sounds of men&rsquo;s voices and women&rsquo;s
shrieks from within the castle, but the doors were
fast barred, while the maid, in her terror, beat on
the portal with her palms, and begged them, for the
love of God, to let her in. The cowards, refused,
and in the meantime the great bear, irritated by the
dangling chain, made a rush towards the child.
Hereward dashed forward, shouting to distract the
bear, and just managed to stop his charge at the girl.
The savage animal turned on the new-comer, who
needed all his agility to escape the monster&rsquo;s terrible
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg&nbsp;341]</a></span>
onset. Seizing his battle-axe, the youth swung it
around his head and split the skull of the furious
beast, which fell dead. It was a blow so mighty that
even Hereward himself was surprised at its deadly effect,
and approached cautiously to examine his victim. In
the meantime the little girl, who proved to be no other
than the king&rsquo;s ward, Alftruda, had watched with
fascinated eyes first the approach of the monster, and
then, as she crouched in terror, its sudden slaughter;
and now she summoned up courage to run to Hereward,
who had always been kind to the pretty child, and to
fling herself into his arms. &ldquo;Kind Hereward,&rdquo; she
whispered, &ldquo;you have saved me and killed the bear.
I love you for it, and I must give you a kiss, for my
dame says so do all ladies that choose good knights to
be their champions. Will you be mine?&rdquo; As she
spoke she kissed Hereward again and again.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 414px;">
<img src="images/hmlbr50.jpg" width="414" height="600" alt="" />
<a name="image_page_340" id="image_page_340"></a>
</div>

<p class="caption">Alftruda</p>


<h3>Hereward&rsquo;s Trick on the Knights</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Where have they all gone, little one?&rdquo; asked the
young noble; and Alftruda replied: &ldquo;We were all out
here in the courtyard watching the young men at their
exercises, when we heard a crash and a roar, and the
cage burst open, and we saw the dreadful Fairy Bear.
They all ran, the ladies and knights, but I was the last,
and they were so frightened that they shut themselves
in and left me outside; and when I beat at the door
and prayed them to let me in they would not, and I
thought the bear would eat me, till you came.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cowards!&rdquo; cried Hereward. &ldquo;And they think
themselves worthy of knighthood when they will save
their own lives and leave a child in danger! They
must be taught a lesson. Martin, come hither and aid
me.&rdquo; When Martin came, the two, with infinite trouble,
raised the carcase of the monstrous beast, and placed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg&nbsp;342]</a></span>
it just where the bower door, opening, would show it
at once. Then Hereward bade Alftruda call to the
knights in the bower that all was safe and they could
come out, for the bear would not hurt them. He and
Martin, listening, heard with great glee the bitter
debate within the bower as to who should risk his life to
open the door, the many excuses given for refusal, the
mischievous fun in Alftruda&rsquo;s voice as she begged some
one to open to her, and, best of all, the cry of horror
with which the knight who had ventured to draw the bolt
shut the door again on seeing the Fairy Bear waiting to
enter. Hereward even carried his trick so far as to
thrust the bear heavily against the bower door, making
all the people within shriek and implore the protection
of the saints. Finally, when he was tired of the jest, he
convinced the valiant knights that they might emerge
safely from their retirement, and showed how he, a
stripling of seventeen, had slain the monster at one blow.
From that time Hereward was the darling of the whole
castle, petted, praised, beloved by all its inmates, except
his jealous rivals.</p>


<h3>Hereward Leaves Northumbria</h3>

<p>The foreign knights grew so jealous of the Saxon
youth, and so restive under his shafts of sarcastic ridicule,
that they planned several times to kill him, and once or
twice nearly succeeded. This insecurity, and a feeling
that perhaps Earl Siward had some kinship with the
Fairy Bear, and would wish to avenge his death, made
Hereward decide to quit Gilbert&rsquo;s castle. The spirit of
adventure was strong upon him, the sea seemed to call
him; now that he had been acknowledged superior to
the other noble youths in Gilbert&rsquo;s household, the
castle no longer afforded a field for his ambition.
Accordingly he took a sad leave of Alftruda, an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg&nbsp;343]</a></span>
affectionate one of Sir Gilbert, who wished to knight
him for his brave deed, and a mocking one of his
angry and unsuccessful foes.</p>


<h3>Hereward in Cornwall</h3>

<p>Entering into a merchant-ship, he sailed for Cornwall,
and there was taken to the court of King Alef,
a petty British chief, who, on true patriarchal lines,
disposed of his children as he would, and had betrothed
his fair daughter to a terrible Pictish giant, breaking
off, in order to do it, her troth-plight with Prince
Sigtryg of Waterford, son of a Danish king in Ireland.
Hereward was ever chivalrous, and little Alftruda had
made him feel pitiful to all maidens. Seeing speedily
how the princess loathed her new betrothed, a hideous,
misshapen wretch, nearly eight feet high, he determined
to slay him. With great deliberation he picked a
quarrel with the giant, and killed him the next day in
fair fight; but King Alef was driven by the threats of the
vengeful Pictish tribe to throw Hereward and his man
Martin into prison, promising trial and punishment on
the morrow.</p>


<h3>Hereward Released from Prison</h3>

<p>To the young Saxon&rsquo;s surprise, the released princess
appeared to be as grieved and as revengeful as any
follower of the Pictish giant, and she not only advocated
prison and death the next day, but herself superintended
the tying of the thongs that bound the two strangers.
When they were left to their lonely confinement Hereward
began to blame the princess for hypocrisy, and to
protest the impossibility of a man&rsquo;s ever knowing what a
woman wants. &ldquo;Who would have thought,&rdquo; he cried,
&ldquo;that that beautiful maiden loved a giant so hideous as
this Pict? Had I known, I would never have fought
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg&nbsp;344]</a></span>
him, but her eyes said to me, &lsquo;Kill him,&rsquo; and I have
done so; this is how she rewards me!&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied
Martin, &ldquo;this is how&rdquo;; and he cut Hereward&rsquo;s bonds,
laughing silently to himself. &ldquo;Master, you were so
indignant with the lady that you could not make
allowances for her. I knew that she must pretend to
grieve, for her father&rsquo;s sake, and when she came to test
our bonds I was sure of it, for as she fingered a knot
she slipped a knife into my hands, and bade me use it.
Now we are free from our bonds, and must try to escape
from our prison.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>The Princess Visits the Captives</h3>

<p>In vain, however, the master and man ranged round
the room in which they were confined; it was a tiny
chapel, with walls and doors of great thickness, and
violently as Hereward exerted himself, he could make
no impression on either walls or door, and, sitting
sullenly down on the altar steps, he asked Martin what
good was freedom from bonds in a secure prison.
&ldquo;Much, every way,&rdquo; replied the servant; &ldquo;at least we
die with free hands; and I, for my part, am content to
trust that the princess has some good plan, if we will
only be ready.&rdquo; While he was speaking they heard
footsteps just outside the door, and the sound of a key
being inserted into the lock. Hereward beckoned
silently to Martin, and the two stood ready, one at
each side of the door, to make a dash for freedom, and
Martin was prepared to slay any who should hinder.
To their great surprise, the princess entered, accompanied
by an old priest bearing a lantern, which he set
down on the altar step, and then the princess turned
to Hereward, crying, &ldquo;Pardon me, my deliverer!&rdquo;
The Saxon was still aggrieved and bewildered, and
replied: &ldquo;Do you now say &lsquo;deliverer&rsquo;? This afternoon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg&nbsp;345]</a></span>
it was &lsquo;murderer, villain, cut-throat.&rsquo; How
shall I know which is your real mind?&rdquo; The princess
almost laughed as she said: &ldquo;How stupid men are!
What could I do but pretend to hate you, since otherwise
the Picts would have slain you then and us all
afterwards, but I claimed you as my victims, and you
have been given to me. How else could I have come
here to-night? Now tell me, if I set you free will
you swear to carry a message for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">Hereward and the Princess</p>


<h3>Sigtryg Ranaldsson of Waterford</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Whither shall I go, lady, and what shall I say?&rdquo; asked
Hereward. &ldquo;Take this ring, my ring of betrothal, and
go to Prince Sigtryg, son of King Ranald of Waterford.
Say to him that I am beset on every side, and beg him
to come and claim me as his bride; otherwise I fear I
may be forced to marry some man of my father&rsquo;s
choosing, as I was being driven to wed the Pictish
giant. From him you have rescued me, and I thank
you; but if my betrothed delays his coming it may
be too late, for there are other hateful suitors who would
make my father bestow my hand upon one of them.
Beg him to come with all speed.&rdquo; &ldquo;Lady, I will go now,&rdquo;
said Hereward, &ldquo;if you will set me free from this vault.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>Hereward Binds the Princess</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Go quickly, and safely,&rdquo; said the princess; &ldquo;but
ere you go you have one duty to fulfil: you must bind
me hand and foot, and fling me, with this old priest, on
the ground.&rdquo; &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said Hereward, &ldquo;will I bind
a woman; it were foul disgrace to me for ever.&rdquo; But
Martin only laughed, and the maiden said again:
&ldquo;How stupid men are! I must pretend to have been
overpowered by you, or I shall be accused of having
freed you, but I will say that I came hither to question
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg&nbsp;346]</a></span>
you, and you and your man set on me and the priest,
bound us, took the key, and so escaped. So shall you
be free, and I shall have no blame, and my father no
danger; and may Heaven forgive the lie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hereward reluctantly agreed, and, with Martin&rsquo;s help,
bound the two hand and foot and laid them before the
altar; then, kissing the maiden&rsquo;s hand, and swearing
loyalty and truth, he turned to depart. But the princess
had one question to ask. &ldquo;Who are you, noble stranger,
so gallant and strong? I would fain know for whom
to pray.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am Hereward Leofricsson, and my father
is the Earl of Mercia.&rdquo; &ldquo;Are you that Hereward who
slew the Fairy Bear? Little wonder is it that you have
slain my monster and set me free.&rdquo; Then master and
man left the chapel, after carefully turning the key in the
lock. Making their way to the shore, they succeeded
in getting a ship to carry them to Ireland, and in course
of time reached Waterford.</p>


<h3>Prince Sigtryg</h3>

<p>The Danish kingdom of Waterford was ruled by
King Ranald, whose only son, Sigtryg, was about Hereward&rsquo;s
age, and was as noble-looking a youth as the
Saxon hero. The king was at a feast, and Hereward,
entering the hall with the captain of the vessel, sat
down at one of the lower tables; but he was not one of
those who can pass unnoticed. The prince saw him,
distinguished at once his noble bearing, and asked him
to come to the king&rsquo;s own table. He gladly obeyed,
and as he drank to the prince and their goblets touched
together he contrived to drop the ring from the
Cornish princess into Sigtryg&rsquo;s cup. The prince saw
and recognised it as he drained his cup, and, watching
his opportunity, left the hall, and was soon followed by
his guest.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg&nbsp;347]</a></span></p>

<h3>Hereward and Sigtryg</h3>

<p>Outside in the darkness Sigtryg turned hurriedly to
Hereward, saying, &ldquo;You bring me a message from my
betrothed?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, if you are that Prince Sigtryg to
whom the Princess of Cornwall was affianced.&rdquo; &ldquo;Was
affianced! What do you mean? She is still my lady
and my love.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yet you leave her there unaided,
while her father gives her in marriage to a hideous
giant of a Pict, breaking her betrothal, and driving
the hapless maiden to despair. What kind of love is
yours?&rdquo; Hereward said nothing yet about his own
slaying of the giant, because he wished to test Prince
Sigtryg&rsquo;s sincerity, and he was satisfied, for the prince
burst out: &ldquo;Would to God that I had gone to her
before! but my father needed my help against foreign
invaders and native rebels. I will go immediately and
save my lady or die with her!&rdquo; &ldquo;No need of that,
for I killed that giant,&rdquo; said Hereward coolly, and
Sigtryg embraced him in joy and they swore blood-brotherhood
together. Then he asked: &ldquo;What
message do you bring me, and what means her
ring?&rdquo; The other replied by repeating the Cornish
maiden&rsquo;s words, and urging him to start at once if
he would save his betrothed from some other hateful
marriage.</p>


<h3>Return to Cornwall</h3>

<p>The prince went at once to his father, told him the
whole story, and obtained a ship and men to journey to
Cornwall and rescue the princess; then, with Hereward
by his side, he set sail, and soon landed in Cornwall,
hoping to obtain his bride peaceably. To his grief he
learnt that the princess had just been betrothed to a
wild Cornish leader, Haco, and the wedding feast was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg&nbsp;348]</a></span>
to be held that very day. Sigtryg was greatly enraged,
and sent a troop of forty Danes to King Alef demanding
the fulfilment of the troth-plight between himself
and his daughter, and threatening vengeance if it were
broken. To this threat the king returned no answer,
and no Dane came back to tell of their reception.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 416px;">

<a name="image_page_348" id="image_page_348"></a>
</div>

<p class="caption">Hereward and Sigtryg</p>


<h3>Hereward in the Enemy&rsquo;s Hall</h3>

<p>Sigtryg would have waited till morning, trusting in
the honour of the king, but Hereward disguised himself
as a minstrel and obtained admission to the bridal
feast, where he soon won applause by his beautiful
singing. The bridegroom, Haco, in a rapture offered
him any boon he liked to ask, but he demanded only a
cup of wine from the hands of the bride. When she
brought it to him he flung into the empty cup the
betrothal ring, the token she had sent to Sigtryg, and
said: &ldquo;I thank thee, lady, and would reward thee for
thy gentleness to a wandering minstrel; I give back
the cup, richer than before by the kind thoughts of
which it bears the token.&rdquo; The princess looked at
him, gazed into the goblet, and saw her ring; then,
looking again, she recognised her deliverer and knew
that rescue was at hand.</p>


<h3>Haco&rsquo;s Plan</h3>

<p>While men feasted Hereward listened and talked,
and found out that the forty Danes were prisoners, to
be released on the morrow when Haco was sure of his
bride, but released useless and miserable, since they
would be turned adrift blinded. Haco was taking his
lovely bride back to his own land, and Hereward saw
that any rescue, to be successful, must be attempted
on the march. Yet he knew not the way the bridal
company would go, and he lay down to sleep in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg&nbsp;349]</a></span>
hall, hoping that he might hear something more.
When all men slept a dark shape came gliding
through the hall and touched Hereward on the
shoulder; he slept lightly, and awoke at once to
recognise the old nurse of the princess. &ldquo;Come to
her now,&rdquo; the old woman whispered, and Hereward
went, though he knew not that the princess was still
true to her lover. In her bower, which she was
soon to leave, Haco&rsquo;s sorrowful bride awaited the
messenger.</p>


<h3>Rescue for Haco&rsquo;s Bride</h3>

<p>Sadly she smiled on the young Saxon as she said:
&ldquo;I knew your face again in spite of the disguise, but
you come too late. Bear my farewell to Sigtryg, and
say that my father&rsquo;s will, not mine, makes me false to
my troth-plight.&rdquo; &ldquo;Have you not been told, lady,
that he is here?&rdquo; asked Hereward. &ldquo;Here?&rdquo; the
princess cried. &ldquo;I have not heard. He loves me still
and has not forsaken me?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, lady, he is too true
a lover for falsehood. He sent forty Danes yesterday to
demand you of your father and threaten his wrath if he
refused.&rdquo; &ldquo;And I knew not of it,&rdquo; said the princess
softly; &ldquo;yet I had heard that Haco had taken some
prisoners, whom he means to blind.&rdquo; &ldquo;Those are our
messengers, and your future subjects,&rdquo; said Hereward.
&ldquo;Help me to save them and you. Do you know
Haco&rsquo;s plans?&rdquo; &ldquo;Only this, that he will march
to-morrow along the river, and where the ravine is
darkest and forms the boundary between his kingdom
and my father&rsquo;s the prisoners are to be blinded and
released.&rdquo; &ldquo;Is it far hence?&rdquo; &ldquo;Three miles to the
eastward of this hall,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;We will be
there. Have no fear, lady, whatever you may see, but
be bold and look for your lover in the fight.&rdquo; So
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg&nbsp;350]</a></span>
saying, Hereward kissed the hand of the princess, and
passed out of the hall unperceived by any one.</p>


<h3>The Ambush</h3>

<p>Returning to Sigtryg, the young Saxon told all that
he had learnt, and the Danes planned an ambush in the
ravine where Haco had decided to blind and set free
his captives. All was in readiness, and side by side
Hereward and Sigtryg were watching the pathway from
their covert, when the sound of horses&rsquo; hoofs heard on
the rocks reduced them to silence. The bridal procession
came in strange array: first the Danish prisoners
bound each between two Cornishmen, then Haco and
his unhappy bride, and last a great throng of Cornishmen.
Hereward had taken command, that Sigtryg
might look to the safety of his lady, and his plan
was simplicity itself. The Danes were to wait till their
comrades, with their guards, had passed through the
ravine; then while the leader engaged Haco, and
Sigtryg looked to the safety of the princess, the Danes
would release the prisoners and slay every Cornishman,
and the two parties of Danes, uniting their forces, would
restore order to the land and destroy the followers of
Haco.</p>


<h3>Success</h3>

<p>The whole was carried out exactly as Hereward had
planned. The Cornishmen, with Danish captives, passed
first without attack; next came Haco, riding grim and
ferocious beside his silent bride, he exulting in his
success, she looking eagerly for any signs of rescue.
As they passed Hereward sprang from his shelter,
crying, &ldquo;Upon them, Danes, and set your brethren
free!&rdquo; and himself struck down Haco and smote off
his head. There was a short struggle, but soon the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg&nbsp;351]</a></span>
rescued Danes were able to aid their deliverers, and the
Cornish guards were all slain; the men of King Alef,
never very zealous for the cause of Haco, fled, and the
Danes were left masters of the field. Sigtryg had in
the meantime seen to the safety of the princess, and
now placing her between himself and Hereward, he
escorted her to the ship, which soon brought them to
Waterford and a happy bridal. The Prince and Princess
of Waterford always recognised in Hereward their
deliverer and best friend, and in their gratitude wished
him to dwell with them always; but he knew &ldquo;how hard
a thing it is to look into happiness through another
man&rsquo;s eyes,&rdquo; and would not stay. His roving and
daring temper drove him to deeds of arms in other
lands, where he won a renown second to none, but he
always felt glad in his own heart, even in later days,
when unfaithfulness to a woman was the one great sin of
his life, that his first feats of arms had been wrought to
rescue two maidens from their hapless fate, and that he
was rightly known as Hereward the Saxon, the Champion
of Women.</p>

<p><b>Transcriber's Note</b></p>

<p>Minor typographic errors in punctuation have been corrected without note.
Hyphen inconsistencies have been corrected without note where there was a prevalence of
one formation over another.</p>

<p>There is some variation in spelling, sometimes of proper names, often between the main
text and quoted texts, and a number of archaic words. These remain as printed, unless they were an obvious
typographic error, which were amended as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

failed they gave no heed, but took others ..."</p>

</div>

<p>There were some instances of omitted text; these were all checked against another
edition of the text, and, in the case of the omitted page references,
cross-checked against this edition, and repaired as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Page <a href="#Page_347">347</a>&mdash;omitted word (marriage) inserted at the end of the section just prior to "Return to
Cornwall"&mdash;"... he would save his betrothed from some other hateful marriage."</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_370">370</a>&mdash;the entry for Priam had no page number reference; 95 inserted.</p></div>

<p>The frontispiece illustration has been moved to follow the title page. Other illustrations
have been moved so that they are near the text they refer to. Some of the illustration
captions have the artist's name included, some do not; these are all reproduced as printed.</p>
